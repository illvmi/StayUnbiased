"Couple held for series of housebreakings, robberies since January","MELAKA: Police have arrested a couple suspected of involvement in seven housebreakings and robbery cases in Melaka and neighbouring states since January this year.

Melaka Tengah police chief ACP Christopher Patit said the unemployed lovebirds, aged 24 to 31, were arrested in Kuala Kurau, Perak, on June 4.

""On May 28, police received two reports involving a housebreaking and robbery in the Melaka Tengah district linked to the couple.

""Their modus operandi included targeting homestays and stealing various electrical appliances and furniture from the premises,"" he said in a statement Saturday (June 21).

Initial investigations found that the pair were involved in three housebreaking and robbery cases in Melaka Tengah and four others in Kuala Lumpur and Selangor, respectively.

Various items, including electrical appliances, household furniture, a gold bracelet, two cars, five pawnshop receipts and five mobile phones were seized.

He said investigations are still underway, and the case is being investigated under Section 457 of the Penal Code for housebreaking and Section 392 of the Penal Code for robbery.

In a separate development, he said a clothing dealer was arrested for allegedly firing a shot with an air pistol at Jalan Johor, Semabok, on June 8.

""Following intelligence gathering and public tip-off, the 35-year-old suspect was arrested in Puchong, Selangor, on June 17.

Police also seized a black bag, a silver-black air pistol bearing the inscription Pietro Beretta Gardone V.T., a speed loader, and 30 ball-bearing bullets.

The suspect has been remanded for seven days until June 23 to assist in the investigation under Section 33 of the Arms Act 1960 and Section 427 of the Penal Code for mischief.

The case is still under investigation, and he urged the public not to speculate, as it could interfere with the ongoing probe. – Bernama",REAL
Chinese team’s edible fruit coating can more than double shelf life: paper,"Chinese scientists have developed an edible, washable protein-based coating that can extend the shelf life of fruit by 2½ times, by reducing moisture loss and microbial growth.

The low-cost coating was tested across 17 varieties of whole and cut fruits, including strawberry, tomato, kiwi and mango. It was shown to effectively delay rot by almost a week or more, at a cost of just 9 US cents per kilogram of fruit, according to a paper in the peer-reviewed journal Nature Communications.

The new strategy is as effective as existing preservation methods but reduces carbon dioxide emissions and the potential for toxicity, offering a promising solution to a major factor in global food waste.

“Addressing critical challenges in perishable fruit preservation ... we present an eco-friendly amyloid-like protein coating strategy developed through computer-aided molecular simulation,” the team led by researchers at Shaanxi Normal University said in their paper published on May 31.

“With edible properties, easy washability, and low cost, the coating demonstrates universal applicability for post-harvest and fresh-cut fruits.”

Around a third of all food produced globally is wasted, most of it perishable items like fruit and vegetables.

While all fruit have a natural protective barrier on their surface, harvesting renders them easily perishable due to dehydration, microbial growth, oxidation and ageing, thus limiting shelf life.

Strategies explored to extend the shelf life of fruit include genetic modification, wax coating, cold storage, and using “harmful” chemical preservatives such as formaldehyde.

While the waxing of fruit is widely adopted, there are concerns over the health implications of long-term consumption, due to the potential of wax to restrict oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange, according to the research team.

Meanwhile, cold storage may be more biosafe than some of the other methods, but it is expensive and energy-intensive, which adds to global carbon emissions.

Functional coating technologies using natural substances are a promising alternative, but developing a combination of materials that can evenly spread and adhere over the water-repellent fruit cuticle poses a challenge.

The researchers chose to use a phase-transitioned, amyloid-like protein, a type of material that is used to make underwater adhesives and stain-resistant fabric coatings.

Amyloid-like proteins are soluble and can be sprayed onto the surface of fruit. The researchers combined this with molecules of antimicrobial materials to make their coating.

“The superior performance of the amyloid-like protein coating stems from its enhanced spreadability, film formation, adhesion robustness and uniformity on fruit surfaces, which result in improved coating stability and prolonged preservation,” the team said in the paper.

“Our coating reduces carbon emissions by 90 per cent compared to standard refrigeration practices while extending shelf life by 2.5 times.”

The coating can delay fruit rot while achieving 60 to 98 per cent nutrient retention, which is more efficient than chemical preservation without the risk of toxicity, according to the paper.

While bare strawberries showed noticeable signs of decay after four days and severe fungal growth by day 10, the coated strawberries showed no apparent decay over this period.

The coating was able to extend the shelf life of cherry tomatoes from six to 16 days, kumquats from 15 to 30 days, and from two to eight days for both bananas and mangoes.

The material was also able to function under high temperatures, extending the shelf life of strawberries by three days under 42 degrees Celsius (107.6 degrees Fahrenheit).

While freshly cut uncoated apples showed bacterial presence on day two, the coated ones did not show such signs until day eight, indicating that the coating could delay browning and decay even on cut and peeled fruit.

“These findings underscore the universal fresh-keeping capability of the [coating] for fruit, doubling or even quintupling the typical shelf life of highly perishable fruits,” the team said.

Researchers from Tianjin University, Xinjiang Normal University, Changan University and the Second Affiliated Hospital of Xian Jiaotong University also took part in the study.

The biosafety of the coating was tested by feeding rats with spray-coated rat food. The animals exhibited no “distinct pathological alterations” and their blood, kidney and liver function tests were normal.

“The biocompatible, edible, and easily washable nature of the [amyloid-like protein] coating provides a practical and safer alternative for food preservation,” the team asserted.

"Expansion of SST burdens people and raises prices, says Dr Wee","PETALING JAYA: The expansion of the Sales and Services Tax (SST) will further burden the people and give businesses an excuse to raise prices, says MCA president Datuk Seri Dr Wee Ka Siong.

He said that unlike the Goods and Services Tax (GST), the SST lacks transparency, consistency, and the capacity to generate sustainable revenue.

“The government’s continued expansion of SST, likely due to fiscal pressure, is a burden to the people and gives businesses an excuse to raise prices.

“MCA urges the government to take these concerns seriously and consider the constructive feedback from all sectors,” he said on Facebook on Saturday (June 21).

Dr Wee said that reintroducing the GST could ensure the stability and strength of the country.

He said that the GST is widely recognised for its transparency and efficiency.

“A responsible approach would be to exempt certain SMEs and vulnerable groups from the policy, rather than just postponing the rollout.

“A delay is only a short-term fix. In fact, it should be seen as a starting point for reviving the GST,” he said at the E-Invoice Seminar hosted by the MCA Political Education Committee and School of Political Studies earlier today.

Dr Wee added that if GST is implemented, the e-invoice function would be included in the taxation software.

“I emphasised that while the government announced a revised timeline for e-invoice implementation on June 5, simply delaying it won’t solve the root issues. MCA is of the view that the e-invoice component is a subset of the GST system,” he added.

Last week, Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim said that reintroducing GST would unfairly burden lower-income earners.

He said the implementation of GST would mean the poor, including fishermen, smallholders, low-wage earners, and street vendors, would be taxed on everyday essentials.

On June 9, the Finance Ministry announced that the reviewed and expanded SST rates would come into effect next month.

The measure is aimed at strengthening the country’s fiscal position by increasing revenue and broadening the tax base, the ministry said.",REAL
Russia's Putin calls for quick development of drone forces,"(Reuters) -Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday that drones had played a major role in the conflict in Ukraine and called for the rapid development and deployment of separate drone forces within the military.

""We are currently creating unmanned systems troops as a separate branch of the military and we need to ensure their rapid and high-quality deployment and development,"" Russian news agencies quoted him as saying at a meeting on arms development.

Drones have played a leading role for both sides in the more than three-year-old conflict pitting Moscow against Kyiv. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has since the outbreak of the war in February 2022 stressed the importance of developing a domestic drone development and production industry.

Putin told the second day of the gathering that Russia was well aware how Ukraine was dealing with the issue.

""But on the whole, I do not believe we are lagging behind on anything,"" he was quoted as saying. ""More to the point, it seems to me we are bringing together good experience with a view to creating just such forces.""

Russian Defence Minister Andrei Belousov proposed the creation of a drone force late last year, setting a target date of the third quarter of 2025.

Putin also stressed developing air defences, which he said had destroyed more than 80,000 targets during the conflict that Russia still calls a special military operation.

""In this respect, a new state armaments programme must ensure the construction of a versatile air defence system capable of operating in any circumstances and efficiently striking air attack weapons, regardless of their type,"" he said.

On the opening day of the meeting, Putin called for due attention to be paid to the nuclear triad of land-based, sea-based and aircraft-launched weapons.

Air India crash survivor says he escaped through broken emergency exit,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) -The sole survivor of the Air India plane crash that killed more than 240 people said he walked out of a broken emergency exit after the aircraft hit a medical college hostel in the city of Ahmedabad.

Ramesh Viswashkumar, who police said was on seat 11A near the emergency exit and managed to escape through the broken hatch, was filmed after Thursday's crash limping on the street in a blood-stained T-shirt with bruises on his face.

That social media footage of the British national of Indian origin was broadcast on nearly all of India's news channels after the Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner plummeted soon after take-off and erupted in a ball of fire.

It was the worst aviation disaster in a decade.

""I don't believe how I survived. For some time I thought I was also going to die,"" 40-year-old Viswashkumar told Indian state broadcaster DD News from his hospital bed on Friday.

""But when I opened my eyes, I realised I was alive and I tried to unbuckle myself from the seat and escape from where I could. It was in front of my eyes that the air hostess and others (died)"".

Police said some people at the hostel and others on the ground were also killed in the crash. Rescue workers were searching for missing people and aircraft parts in the charred buildings of the hostel on Friday.

Viswashkumar said the plane appeared to come to a standstill in midair for a few seconds shortly after take-off and the green and white cabin lights were turned on.

He said he could feel the engine thrust increasing but then the plane ""crashed with speed into the hostel.""

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who arrived in his home state of Gujarat to visit the crash site, also met Viswashkumar in the hospital on Friday.

Doctors told local media that he did not sustain any major injuries.

""The side of the plane I was in landed on the ground, and I could see that there was space outside the aircraft, so when my door broke I tried to escape through it and I did,"" Viswashkumar said.

""The opposite side of the aircraft was blocked by the building wall so nobody could have come out of there.""

Viswashkumar said he walked out of the crash site with only burn injuries on his left arm.

Indonesia evacuates 100 citizens from Iran and Israel amid regional tensions,"JAKARTA (Bernama): Indonesia has evacuated 100 of its citizens from Iran and Israel amid rising tensions in the region, Foreign Minister Sugiono, who goes by a single name, said on Saturday.

Of those evacuated, 96 individuals - including 93 Indonesian citizens, three embassy staff, and one Iranian national married to an Indonesian - crossed the Iran-Azerbaijan border and arrived safely in Baku.

""They are now resting in Baku after a 16-hour journey. The journey went relatively safely and smoothly, although the border was more crowded than usual,” he said in a video statement released by the ministry from Istanbul.

The remaining four Indonesians were evacuated in a separate operation from Israel via Jordan and are reported to be in good condition.

Sugiono said the ministry remained in close contact with its nationals in the region and that the first phase of the evacuation had proceeded smoothly.

"BNM: Food prices up 17.5pc since 2020 but wages lag, fuelling Malaysia’s cost-of-living strain","KUALA LUMPUR, June 17 — Controlling inflation alone is insufficient to alleviate cost-of-living pressures, said Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM), highlighting the urgent need for structural reforms to address stagnant wage growth and ensure that incomes keep pace with rising prices.

Deputy Governor Datuk Marzunisham Omar said that although headline inflation has eased significantly due to timely monetary policy tightening, price levels remain elevated, thereby reducing household purchasing power amid moderate wage growth.

“From the first quarter of 2020 (1Q 2020) to the 1Q 2025, the Consumer Price Index cumulatively increased by 9.8 per cent, while prices for food and beverages rose even higher at 17.5 per cent.

“In contrast, nominal private sector wages per worker increased by only 7.9 per cent over the same period...So, in real terms, wages per worker declined by 1.9 per cent, hence why we are feeling the pressure of the rising cost of living,” he said.

Marzunisham said this during a panel session on the topic ‘Managing Inflation, Easing Cost: A Policy Perspective’ at the Sasana Symposium 2025 hosted by BNM today.

He pointed out that while it is commonly argued that wages should reflect productivity, data from the 1Q 2022 to 2Q 2025 revealed that productivity per worker rose by 7.4 per cent, yet real wages declined during the same period.

“This clearly illustrates, particularly at the micro level, a structural misalignment between productivity gains and wage growth,” he added.

Meanwhile, he said Malaysia should focus on creating more high-paying and skilled jobs. This is where investments come into the picture, and attracting the right kind of investment is crucial to creating high-skilled jobs that lead to high income.

He highlighted that Malaysia recorded very encouraging investment approval numbers in 2023 and 2024, and the percentage of high-skilled jobs in the economy increased to about 30 per cent, an increase from 25 per cent a few years ago.

Marzunisham said that attention must also be given to the supply side, where policy interventions are necessary, noting the ongoing concerns from employers regarding the quality of graduates entering the labour market.

“Between 2022 and 2023, around 260,000 fresh graduates entered the job market. However, only about 150,000 high-skilled jobs were created annually during that period, resulting in a gap of nearly 100,000.

“That’s why we see underemployment among graduates remaining high — about 36 per cent of our graduates are working in mid- or low-skilled jobs, simply because they cannot secure high-skilled employment,” he said.

Additionally, he noted that employers are complaining that they cannot find the right skilled workers, which underscores the need to improve training and address the skill mismatch among fresh graduates.

He also pointed out that some countries have adopted differentiated minimum wages based on skill levels, and emphasised the need to focus on the broader ecosystem that shapes how wages are determined.

Marzunisham also highlighted that some countries have introduced differentiated minimum wages, where the minimum wage is set according to skill levels, adding that another focus area should be the overall ecosystem of how wages are determined.

“The collaboration and engagement between employers, employees, and government unions, for example, is important, so that all these actors, all these participants, come into engagement in deciding how wages should be increased in the country, rather than leave it to the public forces,” he said. — Bernama",REAL

Israel attacks Iran's capital with explosions booming across Tehran,"JERUSALEM: Israel attacked Iran's capital early Friday, with explosions booming across Tehran as Israel said it targeted nuclear and military sites.

The attack comes as tensions have reached new heights over Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear program. The Board of Governors at the International Atomic Energy Agency for the first time in 20 years on Thursday censured Iran over it not working with its inspectors. Iran immediately announced it would establish a third enrichment site in the country and swap out some centrifuges for more-advanced ones.

Israel for years has warned it will not allow Iran to build a nuclear weapon, something Tehran insists it doesn’t want - though official there have repeatedly warned it could build them. The U.S. has been preparing for something to happen, already pulling some diplomats from Iraq’s capital and offering voluntary evacuations for the families of U.S. troops in the wider Middle East.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in an address on YouTube that the attacks will continue ""for as many days at it takes to remove this threat.”

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Israel took ""unilateral action against Iran” and that Israel advised the U.S. that it believed the strikes were necessary for its self-defense.

""We are not involved in strikes against Iran and our top priority is protecting American forces in the region,” Rubio said in a statement released by the White House.

Rubio also issued a warning to Iran that it should not target U.S. interests or personnel.

People in Tehran awoke to the sound of the blast. State television acknowledged the blast.

It wasn't immediately clear what had been hit, though smoke could be rising from Chitgar, a neighborhood in western Tehran. There are no known nuclear sites in that area - but it wasn't immediately clear if anything was happening in the rest of the country.

An Israeli military official says that his country targeted Iranian nuclear sites, without identifying them.

The official spoke to journalists on condition of anonymity to discuss the ongoing operation, which is also targeting military sites.

Benchmark Brent crude spiked on the attack, rising nearly 5% on the news.

Israel's Defense Minister Israel Katz said that his country carried out the attack, without saying what it targeted.

""In the wake of the state of Israel’s preventive attack against Iran, missile and drone attacks against Israel and its civilian population are expected immediately,"" he said in a statement.

The statement added that Katz ""signed a special order declaring an emergency situation in the home front.”

""It is essential to listen to instructions from the home front command and authorities to stay in protected areas,” it said

Both Iran and Israel closed their airspace.

As the explosions in Tehran started, President Donald Trump was on the lawn of the White House mingling with members of Congress. It was unclear if he had been informed but the president continued shaking hands and posing for pictures for several minutes.

Trump earlier said he was urging Netanyahu to hold off from taking action for the time being while the administration negotiated with Iran.

""His physical and emotional condition is stable while receiving adequate meals and is being held separately from adult detainees.

""Regardless of the legal process, our role is to ensure the rights and welfare of a child in custody are safeguarded,"" she added.

On June 18, the teen suspect was charged at the Magistrate’s Court with two counts of alleged murder and one count of causing grievous bodily harm.

The incident occurred in the early hours of June 12 at the family’s home in Taman Rambai Mutiara in Bukit Rambai.

""As part of the process of sending students to Egypt, we will conduct a one-year Arabic-language familiarisation course at Usim, as agreed by both the Egyptian and Malaysian governments,” he said.

He was speaking to reporters after attending the launch of the Dunia Melayu Dunia Islam (DMDI) Dakwah Complex and the DMDI Foundation Tahfiz Centre at Maahad Tahfiz Sulaimaniyyah, Kampung Tersusun DMDI Bukit Senggeh, Selandar, here Sunday (May 25).

The ceremony, officiated by the Yang di-Pertua Negeri of Melaka, Tun Mohd Ali Rustam, was also attended by Melaka Chief Minister Datuk Seri Ab Rauf Yusoh and DMDI Foundation chairman Datuk Mohd Ridhwan Mohd Ali.

The DMDI Foundation Tahfiz Centre began construction in 2021 and was completed in February this year, with 37 students enrolled in its first intake.

Ahmad Zahid said the government also prioritised outstanding tahfiz school graduates, especially those with a Malaysian Skills Certificate (SKM) Level 5, to pursue medical studies at Al-Azhar University.

Commenting on PKR request to contest 13 seats in the upcoming Sabah state election, Ahmad Zahid, who is also Umno president, said discussions were still ongoing between Barisan Nasional (BN) and Pakatan Harapan (PH).

""To me, the request is an internal matter among PH component parties, and we fully respect the cooperation between BN and PH as well as the negotiations with local parties in Sabah.

""A final decision will be made once the Sabah state legislative assembly is dissolved,” he said. - Bernama",REAL

Why Malaysia’s smallest bear matters — and what we need to do to save them,"KUALA LUMPUR, June 16 — The sun bear, the world’s smallest bear species, is often easy to overlook.

Yet this shy, fuzzy creature plays a vital role in maintaining the health of Malaysia’s rainforests — from dispersing seeds to creating homes for other animals.

Despite this, many Malaysians remain unaware that the sun bear lives in their own forests, or that it is one of the most endangered bear species in the world.

Conservationist Wong Siew Te has dedicated years to changing that, working to show how these bears are essential for sustaining rainforest ecosystems.

However, he says much remains to be done.

How are they important?

Wong said one of their “jobs” is as seed dispersers — they help regenerate trees by eating fruits and excreting the seeds far from the mother tree.

They also feed on termites, controlling populations that attack mother trees.

When they feed on stingless bees, they carve out cavities in the trees that later become nesting sites for hornbills and flying squirrels.

“They are also ‘food providers’, as a lot of animals actually follow the sun bears around, and when the bears feed on something, they often leave behind scraps that are picked up by pheasants and other birds,” Wong told Malay Mail in an interview.

“This is why they are known as the umbrella species whose protection helps countless other animals.”

Do enough people know?

For the past 17 years, Wong and his team have been working to raise awareness about sun bears and educate the public on their significance in rainforests.

“I think we managed to reach out to people but not a lot,” he said.

Wong said he hopes to see information on wildlife conservation and environmental protection included in the school curriculum.

“Every kid will grow up knowing that there are wildlife and sun bears because still many people do not know that there is a bear called sun bear that lives in their own country,” he added.

“More Malaysians understand about the sun bears today compared to the past, but not all Malaysians know the existence of the sun bears, so this is something we need to catch up on before it is too late,” said Wong.

Meeting the sun bears

In 1998, Wong arrived in Sabah to conduct research for his Master’s degree, which required him to study wild sun bears.

“I happened to be one of the first — to study the sun bears — and I got to discover a lot of amazing things about them and knew how important they are.

“But when I came out of the forest, I saw another extreme — which is deforestation, logging and poaching, it was very sad,” he said.

That project eventually led Wong to start a conservation centre.

In 2004, Wong received a travel grant from Woodland Park Zoo in the US to travel across Sabah, Sarawak and West Malaysia, to try to understand the situation of the captured sun bears in these three regions.

“The findings were actually quite shocking because so many sun bears are being kept in captivity as pets or display animals in roadside zoos, crocodile farms, and none of these bears were being treated nicely or housed in proper facilities,” he said.

Today, the Bornean Sun Bear Conservation Centre (BSBCC) is 17 years old.

Poached, eaten and kept as pets

However, despite Wong’s conservation efforts for the sun bears, threats remain high.

“The biggest threat to the sun bears is still deforestation especially in West Malaysia. After that is hunting and poaching, and followed by sun bears as pets,” he said.

Wong said that habitat fragmentation forces the bears to cross roads to find food or shelter, where they often end up as roadkill.

He added that in the black market, sun bear paws go for about RM5,000 in West Malaysia and RM2,000 in Sabah — based on checks from before the Covid-19 pandemic.

“So what happens is when the mother bear is killed, the bear cub will be placed in the black market for sale,"" Wong said.

He advised the public to immediately report such cases to the authorities if they come across them.

“Offering money — even to buy the bears as a rescue effort will keep the market alive,” he added.

Wong said that while sun bears are protected by strict laws in most parts of Malaysia, in Sarawak the penalties for harming them are much lighter.

“I have been pushing for a stricter law in Sarawak but it’s a lot of work and it will take time.”

The brighter side

Wong said that in recent years, the centre has had to rescue fewer bear cubs, especially from those who used to keep them as pets.

“It’s much less, but it’s not completely eliminated. So 17 years of work and trying to educate the public, there are still very stubborn people.

“Just two weeks ago, there was another sun bear in West Malaysia that went into someone’s house, Perhilitan believes that it’s someone’s house pet,” he added.

What does the centre still need?

The BSBCC was thriving, self-sustaining from eco-tourism, until Covid-19 brought the world to a halt. The centre lost its main income — tourists.

“No tourists, no income. But the bears still needed food, medicine and care. Our costs remained high,” he said.

That was when Wong reached out to the Hasanah Foundation — under sovereign wealth fund Khazanah — which then established a new funding category for animal welfare.

“The grant helped cover bear food, medicine, and partial salaries for bear keepers during the pandemic,” he said.

Looking ahead to 2026, when the sun bear will serve as the Visit Malaysia mascot, Wong said this recognition will help raise global awareness about conservation efforts for the Malaysian bear.

“I’m looking forward to tourists coming to the centre to learn more about the sun bears.

“At the same time, more tourists means more income for the conservation centre,” he added.",REAL
Melaka education activist is first M'sian to co-chair international young scientists platform,"MELAKA: A local education activist has become the first Malaysian elected as co-chair of the Global Young Academy (GYA), an international platform representing young scientists across the globe.

Associate Professor Dr Sam Chan Siok Yee (pic), a registered pharmacist and academic at Universiti Sains Malaysia’s School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, was elected during the GYA’s annual general meeting held in Hyderabad, India, from June 10 to 13.

The event was officiated by India's Education Minister, Dharmendra Pradhan.

Chan will serve alongside returning co-chair, Dr Yensi Flores Bueso of University College Cork, Ireland.

Her election followed a hybrid voting process involving over 70 academics from around the world.

With her appointment, Malaysia assumes a greater role in shaping the organisation’s strategic direction and championing scientific leadership from lower-middle-income countries.

In an interview on Saturday (June 21), Chan described the appointment as a “landmark achievement for Malaysian science and global leadership”.

""My elected role marks a significant step forward for gender representation and regional inclusion in global scientific governance,” she said.

Chan, 41, said that the position is not merely a personal milestone, but also a recognition of the growing impact of Southeast Asian scientists in the international research community.

“I am deeply honoured to serve as co-chair of the GYA and this role reflects the collective progress of our region’s scientific contributions on the world stage,” she said.

Founded in 2010, the GYA promotes international, interdisciplinary, and intergenerational dialogue to address pressing global challenges.

The academy currently includes 22 Malaysian members who actively contribute to scientific progress.

Chan has been involved with the GYA since 2021 and remains committed to strengthening support systems for young researchers worldwide.

She also serves as vice-president and education specialist with the Melaka Action Group of Parents in Education (Magpie).

According to The Hindu Newspaper (India) on June 16, the GYA’s 2025 AGM was held under the theme “Confluence of Visionaries: Empowering Science for Global Change.”

The week-long programme featured sessions on Industry 5.0, human-machine interaction, nutrition and well-being, science-society interfaces and foresight planning.

"Japan upper house election set for July 20, Asahi reports","TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's upcoming upper house election is set for July 20, as Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba decided not to extend the current parliamentary session, the Asahi newspaper reported on Friday, citing multiple unnamed administration officials.

Ishiba also has no plans to dissolve the lower house during the current session, which lasts through June 22, as the main opposition party is unlikely to submit a no-confidence motion against his cabinet, Asahi said.

With that, campaigning for the upper house election will begin on July 3, in line with statutory election schedules, Asahi reported.

The vote is key to the continuity of the Ishiba administration, after his ruling Liberal Democratic Party and coalition partner Komeito lost their majority in the more powerful lower house in a snap election Ishiba called in October shortly after taking office.

Ishiba's approval ratings have recently rebounded from record lows last month that were in part attributed to voters' dissatisfaction with the government's response to soaring rice prices.

A weekend poll conducted by public broadcaster NHK showed Ishiba's cabinet approval rating climbing to 39%, up 6 points from 33% a month earlier.

Over 400kg of rubbish collected in Teluk Likas beach cleanup,"KOTA KINABALU: Over 150 volunteers collected a total of 402kg of rubbish from the shores of Teluk Likas during a beach cleanup campaign here.

This initiative united students, scientists, and diplomats in Sabah's fight against marine pollution.

The programme was jointly organised by Universiti Malaysia Sabah (UMS), the Natural Resources and Environmental Sustainability Ministry (NRES), the French Embassy in Malaysia, and eight secondary schools from Sabah and Labuan.

Teluk Likas is the second most frequented beach in Kota Kinabalu after Tanjung Aru, making its cleanliness and conservation a key public concern.

Participants included students, UMS staff, NRES officers, and representatives from the Minerals and Geoscience Department, Meteorological Department, and the French diplomatic mission.

The schools involved were SMK Elopura (Sandakan), SMK Tandek (Kota Marudu), SMK Sanzac (Kota Kinabalu), SM St. Michael (Penampang), SM Sains Sabah, SMK Pinawantai (Kudat), SMK Labuan, and SMK Tebobon.

French Embassy representative Dominique Husken-Ulbrich said the initiative aligns with global environmental efforts.

“This initiative reflects our commitment to the Paris Agreement and Sustainable Development Goals. It shows that educational and diplomatic collaboration can lead to real impact,” she said.

NRES deputy secretary-general (Development) Datuk Nor Yahati Awang described the event as a crucial step towards coastal conservation.

“Our beaches are national treasures. Through collective action, we can educate the public about their responsibility in protecting the environment,” she said.

UMS marine science programme head Dr Madihah Jaffar Sidek said the cleanup was part of their marine education campaign targeting youth.

“We want students in Sabah to develop a deeper connection with the environment and take ownership as guardians of the marine ecosystem,” she said.

The programme was held in conjunction with UMS’s Ocean Celebration initiative, which also marked the annual World Oceans Day (8 June), Coral Triangle Day (9 June), and World Sea Turtle Day (16 June).",REAL

"Now, everyone can get 5pc discount on Penang’s overhang properties, says chief minister","GEORGE TOWN, June 18 — The Penang government is now giving a 5 per cent discount to anyone who takes up completed but long unsold homes in the state.

Chief Minister Chow Kon Yeow said the decision was made today to help reduce the number of overhang properties in Penang.

“There are 2,729 overhang units in Penang,” he said at a press conference, referring to unsold homes that have been completed for more than nine months.

These homes have a total value of RM2.04 billion, based on data from the National Property Information Centre (Napic) for the first quarter of 2025.

The discount is part of the Madani Ownership Campaign and will last for one year.

It only applies to projects by developers registered with the Penang Housing Board.

Most of the unsold units – 2,044 – are apartments or condominiums.

There are 699 unsold homes priced below RM300,000, worth RM180 million.

Another 730 homes are priced between RM300,001 and RM500,000, worth RM300 million.

Homes priced above RM1 million make up 646 units, with a total value of RM1.07 billion.

The expansion follows the state government’s previous announcement that the discount would apply only to Indian Muslims, which led to public criticism.

Chow later asked the state housing exco, Datuk Seri S. Sundarajoo, to review the policy so that it would be fair to everyone.

“While the current focus has shifted to the 40% net revenue return, the reality is that its implementation remains unclear and continues to be debated from various legal and technical standpoints,” he said in a statement on Friday (May 23).

"Engagement with all sides in Myanmar marks key step towards peace, says Anwar","PUTRAJAYA: The decision by all major stakeholders in Myanmar to participate in direct engagement with Asean leaders marks a significant step forward in efforts to resolve the country's protracted conflict, says Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim.

In an interview with Asean media ahead of the 46th Asean Summit, the Prime Minister said the recent meeting in Bangkok, involving Asean Troika and Myanmar's Foreign Minister U Than Shwe, reflected a shift in attitude, especially from the military junta.

""I think you must give credit to the fact that it is generally a ceasefire, and movements – for example, humanitarian assistance – have been flowing without interruption, including into other areas.

""So what is important is that they allowed or tolerated the fact that I, for example, met both. This is unprecedented and we asked the Troika to come and they all came.

""That's certainly a good beginning because in all this sort of contentious issues, conflict issues, to find conflict resolution, we always start with engagement,"" he said.

Anwar said he had also urged his Asean counterparts in Brunei, Indonesia, Vietnam and Cambodia to engage through multiple channels such as military and diplomatic with the aim of achieving a full ceasefire and ensuring unhindered humanitarian assistance.

On Saturday (May 24), Asean foreign ministers commended Malaysia's proactive leadership in reviving efforts to implement the Five-Point Consensus (5PC) and facilitating constructive dialogue to address the ongoing crisis in Myanmar.

Earlier in May, Anwar initiated separate dialogues with Myanmar's junta leader Min Aung Hlaing and the opposition National Unity Government (NUG), which marked a significant step towards fostering direct engagement between conflicting parties.

The move has been seen as a potential breakthrough in Asean's mediation efforts.

The 5PC was adopted by Asean in April 2021 following the military coup in Myanmar on Feb 1 that year. It calls for an immediate cessation of violence, inclusive dialogue among all parties, the appointment of a special envoy, the delivery of humanitarian assistance, and for the envoy to be granted access to all stakeholders in Myanmar.

Despite its significance, implementation of the consensus has largely stalled due to the junta's continued non-compliance, with the issue remaining a central concern in Asean's ongoing engagement with Myanmar.

On the situation in Gaza, Anwar voiced support for a multilateral approach to reconstruction, proposing that Asean, the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and China could work together on an alternative to United States-driven plans.

He stressed that any rebuilding efforts must reflect the will and aspirations of the Palestinian people.

""The earlier proposal by the United States to treat Gaza as a separate entity is unacceptable. You cannot rebuild without the will of the people,"" he said.

Anwar also reaffirmed Malaysia's strong stance on the Palestine issue and noted an evolving consensus within Asean for an immediate ceasefire, condemnation of atrocities and respect for human rights.

""In Myanmar, even under military rule aid gets through but in Gaza the denial of basic food and medicine is allowed to persist. That is dehumanising,"" he said.

The 46th Asean Summit is being held under Malaysia's 2025 Chairmanship theme ""Inclusivity and Sustainability"". This year also marks Malaysia's fifth time chairing Asean, following previous terms in 1977, 1997, 2005 and 2015. – Bernama",REAL

He is charged under Section 302 of the Penal Code for murder which provides for the death penalty or imprisonment for not less than 30 years but not more than 40 years, and if not sentenced to death, can be whipped not less than 12 strokes.

No plea was recorded from the accused when the charge was read out in Mandarin by the court interpreter as the murder charge falls under the jurisdiction of the High Court.

Meanwhile, for the third charge, the accused is charged with intentionally causing grievous bodily harm to his 13-year-old younger brother by using a folding knife at the same location on the same date and time.

He is charged under Section 326 of the Penal Code for causing grievous bodily harm which provides for a maximum prison sentence of 20 years and a fine or whipping.

The teenager, however, pleaded not guilty to the charge.

The prosecution was conducted by deputy public prosecutor Farah Nabihah Sofian while the accused was represented by lawyer Cassian Anthony, with no bail offered for all three charges.

"Coordinated protests against tourism levels planned in Spain, Portugal and Italy","BARCELONA (Reuters) -Activists against overtourism are planning protests across Spain, Portugal and Italy on Sunday, with one group urging people to bring water pistols to the demonstration in Barcelona.

Anger has been growing in southern Europe against what protesters say are excessive levels of tourism that they complain are forcing locals out of affordable accommodation, pushing up living costs and clogging up city centres.

International travel spending in Europe is expected to rise by 11% to $838 billion this year, with Spain and France among the countries set to receive record numbers of tourists.

Protests are planned in Barcelona and seven other Spanish cities, including Granada, Palma and Ibiza; Portugal's capital Lisbon; and the Italian cities of Venice, Genova, Palermo, Milan and Naples, according to announcements issued by several of the organising groups.

Organisers, some of whom dismiss the counterargument that tourism brings jobs and prosperity, told Reuters that they wanted to build on scattered protests across Spain last year with the coordinated day of action.

They are joining forces with groups in Portugal and Italy under the umbrella of the SET alliance - Sud d'Europa contra la Turistització, or Southern Europe against Overtourism - Daniel Pardo Rivacoba, spokesperson for Barcelona's Neighbourhoods Assembly for Tourism Degrowth, said.

Some 26 million tourists swelled Barcelona's 1.6-million population in 2024. A survey conducted by Barcelona last year showed that 31% of residents considered tourism to be damaging, the highest figure on record.

""When they (officials) say that we have to specialise in tourism, they are basically telling us that you have to get poorer so that other people can get richer,"" Pardo Rivacoba said, complaining of low pay and poor or non-existent contracts.

ANTI-TOURIST GRAFFITI

Graffiti saying ""Tourists go home"" has become an increasingly common sight across the Mediterranean city and Barcelona's tourism agency was spray painted on Thursday with a message about the planned protest.

The agency said in an open letter published on Friday: ""If you hear someone from Barcelona say, 'Tourists, go home', you should know that most of us don't think that way.""

It said the city welcomed tourists because they brought diversity, while underscoring the challenges brought by mass tourism and the measures taken to address them, such as a ban on tourist apartments and an ongoing tourism tax.

Barcelona, which depends on tourism for 15% of its GDP, announced last year it would shut all short-term lets by 2028. The mayor said at the time rents had risen by 68% in the past 10 years and the cost of buying a house had risen by 38%, becoming a driver of inequality, especially among young people.

Jaime Rodriguez de Santiago, head of vacation rental platform Airbnb for Iberia, said this week that Barcelona's restrictions scapegoated short-lets, which he said can help redistribute visitor flows to less crowded parts of a city.

Catalonia's Socialist president also announced the expansion of Barcelona's airport this week, saying it was critical for the airport to become a major hub for intercontinental connections, drawing further condemnation from campaigners.

Demonstrators have been urged to bring water pistols to the Barcelona protest, Pardo Rivacoba said, after groups squirted tourists last year in a protest that was criticised by the government and travel companies.

A Catalonia regional police source said the force would guarantee the right to protest and citizens' right to move freely, but declined to comment further.

The protest in Venice looks set to be more low-key, with one organiser saying members would display banners in two locations to denounce the impact of overtourism. ""Each city in the SET network organises a demonstration in its own way,"" they said.

While residents in Rome or Venice have staged anti-tourism protests, in poorer southern Italy a tourism boom is helping make some neighbourhoods safer and bringing much-needed cash.

Not knowing which group his son, Sergiy, will be in is a torment. “I am told to wait. What else is left for me to do?” said Umanets, as tears welled up in his eyes.

This week Russia and Ukraine began implementing a deal reached at June 2 peace talks in Istanbul to hand over 1,000 prisoners of war each, and also a huge number of human remains.

Alongside the joyful scenes of soldiers returning home and hugging loved ones, there have been macabre images of men dressed in hazmat suits transferring body bags from refrigerated trucks.

Russia said it plans to hand over the remains of around 6,000 Ukrainian soldiers in this phase of the exchange. So far this week, it said it transferred 1,212 sets of remains, while Ukraine said it handed over the bodies of 27 Russian soldiers.

Volodymyr Umanets’s son Sergiy, 49, served in the army as a younger man and volunteered to rejoin shortly after the February 2022 full-scale invasion. He was serving in the Ukrainian military in south-eastern Ukraine when he went missing in combat in December 2023.

His father, who works as a security guard in the town hall in Bucha, outside Kyiv, said he still hopes Sergiy is alive, and that he was captured by the Russian side.

But he acknowledged the possibility that his son may have been killed. He gave authorities a sample of his DNA so that if Sergiy’s remains are recovered, he can be identified.

“You know, I want to know at least something, to get at least some information,” he said.

“I read recently in the newspaper that a young man was declared missing. And during the exchange of bodies, his DNA was identified. He was buried today. I wish I knew at least this.”

Each side has been handing over soldiers’ remains periodically throughout the conflict, but the swap now underway is of an unprecedented scale.

PAINSTAKING PROCESS

For Ukraine, the repatriation of the remains marks the start of a long and painstaking process to identify who they are, how they died, and to notify their families.

The task is made more complicated because sometimes the returned soldiers were killed in explosions so their bodies are in fragments, according to Djordje Alempijevic, a professor of forensic science at Belgrade University who helped examine the remains of people killed in conflicts in the Western Balkans in the 1990s.

An added complication, he said, is that some of the remains have been stored for a long time, and they degrade, even if kept in refrigeration.

In the best case scenario, the bodies are returned with some documents to help identification, said Dmytro Hapchenko, a local council official in Bucha who has worked on remains of people killed in the war.

But he said that does not always happen.

In fact, Ukraine has alleged that Russia’s approach to processing the remains of Ukrainian soldiers has been haphazard.

On June 2, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy told reporters that in previous repatriations of remains, Russia handed over bodies to Ukraine that were actually dead Russian soldiers.

Russia, in response, has accused Ukraine of deliberately delaying the exchange of the remains, stranding trucks with human bodies on the Russian side of the border, a claim denied by Ukraine.

Absent any identifying documents for the returned remains, forensic pathologists will try to conduct an autopsy, said Alempijevic. He said they look for features like old bone fractures, dental characteristics, and metal plates or screws from old surgeries.

Alempijevic, member of the UNSubcommittee for the Prevention of Torture, said autopsies also allowed pathologists to look for evidence of a war crime.

Ukrainian prosecutors have alleged some Ukrainian soldiers were tortured in captivity, or summarily executed, and they are preparing criminal prosecutions. Russia has denied those allegations.

Hapchenko, the Bucha city official, said he was supporting families from his area whose loved ones went missing in the fighting.

“Unfortunately, there are quite a few of them,” he said. Referring to the repatriation of fallen soldiers now underway, he said: “Maybe now they’ll be able to bury them.”

"All must play a role in strengthening unity, Raja of Perlis decrees","KANGAR, June 15 — Unity among people of different races, religions, and ethnicities is a vital asset and a central pillar in achieving the formation of a Madani society and nation, which the government is currently pursuing, said the Raja of Perlis, Tuanku Syed Sirajuddin Jamalullail.

His Royal Highness said that since unity is the key to the success and well-being of the people, continuous efforts must be made by all levels of society.

“Everyone must realise their role and responsibility in contributing to the strengthening of unity and values.

“Unity is not the responsibility of a single party. It requires a collective effort from government agencies, non-governmental organisations, community leaders, educational institutions, and every individual. We all have a part to play.

“Let us make our homes, schools, workplaces, and communities’ platforms to nurture the spirit of unity and love among people,” His Royal Highness said at the official opening of this year’s state-level Unity Week celebration here today.

Gracing the event was Raja Perempuan of Perlis, Tuanku Tengku Fauziah Almarhum Tengku Abdul Rashid.

Raja Muda of Perlis, Tuanku Syed Faizuddin Putra Jamalullail, Raja Puan Muda of Perlis, Tuanku Dr Hajah Lailatul Shahreen Akashah Khalil and Deputy Minister of National Unity, Senator Saraswathy Kandasami were also in attendance.

Tuanku Syed Sirajuddin stated that the challenges to unity have become increasingly complex, ranging from issues of racism to extremist ideologies, emphasising that initiatives like Unity Week should serve as a platform to strengthen inter-ethnic interaction, broaden community networks, and foster understanding among communities.

“Therefore, I hope that this programme will achieve its goals by ensuring that the element of unity becomes the foundation in every action and interaction, based on mutual respect, cooperation, consensus, and tolerance,” the Ruler said.

Tuanku Syed Sirajuddin also urged the people of Perlis, regardless of their background, to continue supporting this noble effort to ensure the continuity of harmony and stability in the state and the nation. — Bernama",REAL

Johor MB: Over RM2 million allocated to upgrade digital systems at state land office to ease transactions,"JOHOR BARU, June 18 — The Johor government has allocated over RM2 million to upgrade the digital systems of the state’s Land and Mines Office (PTG) to improve transaction processes, Menteri Besar Datuk Onn Hafiz Ghazi announced today.

Of the total, RM1.55 million is earmarked for upgrading the Computerised Land Registration System (SPTB) portal.

“This includes enhancements to the Johor PTG’s e-submission, e-search, and e-consent digital services. Online private searches for strata titles are now available and will soon be extended to landed titles as well,” he said in a statement.

An additional RM500,000 has been allocated for developing the e-SBKS system, scheduled to launch in September.

“The e-SBKS system will significantly reduce the time required for land grant returns from 510 days to just 53 days per transaction,” Onn Hafiz said.

He added that the state government is also considering raising the levy fee for property acquisition approvals by foreign interests to address operational costs.

“The proposed levy increase is from two per cent with a minimum of RM20,000 to three per cent with a minimum of RM30,000.

“Additionally, the registration fee for land transfer transactions involving properties valued at RM500,000 and above will see an additional RM500 charge for every RM100,000 increase in property valuation,” he explained.

Onn Hafiz said the proposal was discussed with stakeholders, including the Johor Real Estate and Housing Developers Association of Malaysia (Rehda) and the Johor Bar Committee.

He noted that the levy rate for foreign property acquisitions has remained unchanged since 2014, while land transfer registration fees have not been revised since 2004.

“This initiative demonstrates the state government’s commitment to enhancing public service delivery, making it more efficient, transparent, and responsive to the people’s needs,” he said.

The improvements aim to ease processes for residents, expedite land transaction approvals, and bolster investor confidence in Johor’s public service system.

Onn Hafiz also highlighted additional work process enhancements by the Johor PTG, which have significantly shortened processing times.

“For instance, approvals for foreign interests have been reduced from 70 to 21 days, while local transactions have been cut from 14 to seven days,” he added.",REAL

20 years of make-up neglect proves a skin-credible mistake,"Compiled by FAZLEENA AZIZ, TAN SIN CHOW AND R. ARAVINTHAN

AFTER 20 years of not properly removing her make-up, a 37-year-old woman in Jilin city, China, began suffering from red, itchy and hardened skin.

Sin Chew Daily reported that the woman, known only as Gao, began using makeup at 15 and admitted to almost never removing it properly since. At best, she would rinse her face with water before going to bed.

Her face recently became severely swollen and inflamed. Instead of seeing a dermatologist, she went to a cosmetic clinic and got a “skin booster injection” (also known as mesotherapy).

But afterwards, her face became stiff, the redness deepened into a purplish tone, and the heat and itchiness worsened.

According to the news report, leftover make-up and dirt can irritate the skin, causing redness, itchiness or even allergic reactions such as swelling and blisters.

Some netizens questioned the story’s authenticity, suggesting the woman’s face showed signs of cosmetic surgeries, and it was unlikely she would have been allowed to have make-up on during surgery.

Others said her symptoms were consistent with viral infections or allergic reactions following mesotherapy.

"As police look on, student demonstraters take to KK streets to call for reform (VIDEO)","KOTA KINABALU, June 21 — The steady beating of drums and rousing chants calling for clean governance could be heard throughout Kota Kinabalu’s central business district streets today, as a student-led anti-corruption demonstration walked the streets escorted by uniformed policemen.

It’s a rare sight for most as such protests, complete with megaphones, banners, placards and signs, are usually not allowed by authorities and limited to restricted areas.

A group of some 100 or so people consisting mostly of students from University Malaysia Sabah and civic society gathered in front of the Suria Sabah shopping mall for the second edition of its Gempur Rasuah Sabah rally.

Unlike the first time they had their rally where they marched from UMS to the state administrative building along a busy highway before they were stopped, the police presence this time was much more congenial, without the Light Strike Force unit or heavy arms — mostly helping keep public order on the busy roads.

The police had approved their gathering on June 18 with the caveat they adhered to certain rules.

“It’s quite good to see this. It’s a normal part of democracy and freedom of expression. It’s good to see the police presence and actually helping them. No guns, no attacks, no abuse or disorderly conduct.

“I think it’s good for the government to allow this to happen,” said Datuk Ahmad Abdul Rahman, Sabah’s former State Assembly speaker who was passing by in the vicinity when he saw the commotion.

Many motorists who passed by the group also honked their horns in solidarity with the group.

Organised by student coalition Suara Mahasiswa, the Gempur Rasuah Sabah 2.0 rally participants carried signs denouncing corruption, calling for action against certain politicians and also demanding the authorities solve the water shortage issue which has been plaguing the university for months.

The group left the mall entrance at around 2.30pm and walked towards the main market, when it started pouring.

Stopping briefly to put on raincoats, they continued their march towards Centre Point shopping centre before ending up at Lintasan Deasoka near Gaya Street, where organisers have announced plans for a 24-hour sit-in.

A minor blip occurred when the group came across some people holding up a banner depicting an opposition political party.

Some tension occurred between the two groups but was quickly dismissed with the help of police.

Its leader Muhammad Fadhli Muhammad Kasim said that the students did not want to have any political connections.

He also called for specific action from authorities, including investigations into alleged misconduct involving the Sabah Water Department (JANS) that had led to their water issue, a fully autonomous Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) office in the state, and investigation into the appointment of the state governor.

Not one kilometre away, another smaller, less lively group calling themselves Gerakan Anak Muda dan Mahasiswa Anak Sabah (Gammas), held a demonstration lasting less than 30 minutes at Chong Tien Vun park.

Claiming to be students of the university, their spokesperson Noridi @ Noraidi Maya insisted their gathering is not a counter-rally, but to express solidarity with Chief Minister Datuk Seri Hajiji Noor and “defend the integrity of the government” after the many beneficial policies and provisions for students.

Gammas’s gathering did not obtain police approval but the gathering remained peaceful throughout.

“I was tying flowers to make a garland when I heard an explosion like firecrackers, then I looked towards a motorcycle shop which was just 20 metres away and saw several individuals, including the motorcycle shop workers, running towards my store.

“I thought it was a crow-shooting operation but that hasn’t been staged here for a long time since many trees have been cut down (where crows perch), ... then I realised someone has been shot and killed in a vehicle right in front of the motorcycle shop,” she told Bernama here today.

The woman in her 50s also said that this was the first incident of its kind to occur near Taman Meru Utama in the five years she and her family have been running a grocery and food business.

Russia says it tests new laser defences against drones,"MOSCOW (Reuters) -Russia said on Friday it had conducted large-scale tests of new laser-based systems to defend against drones.

A government statement described the new technology as ""promising"" and said it had been tested against various types of drone in different weather conditions.

It said the anti-drone lasers would become part of a ""universal air defence system"" that President Vladimir Putin said this week Russia needed to build.

""The test results will be used to refine existing models and create systems capable of providing reliable protection against modern air attack weapons. Conducting tests allows us to move on to serial production and upscaling,"" the statement said. An accompanying video showed charred debris from a destroyed drone.

Both sides have deployed drones on a huge scale in the Russia-Ukraine war, using them to spot and hit targets not only on the battlefield but way beyond the front lines.

Ukrainian drones have frequently struck sites deep inside Russia such as oil depots, refineries and airfields, highlighting the need for Moscow to boost its defences.

Earlier this month, Ukrainian drones smuggled close to air bases in trucks inflicted serious damage to Russia's long-range bomber fleet.

"Israel claims killing of Iranian commander who allegedly helped fund, arm Hamas","JERUSALEM, June 21 — Israel's Defence Minister Israel Katz said today that the military had killed a veteran commander in the Iranian Revolutionary Guards' overseas arm, in a strike in an apartment in Iran's Qom province.

The commander, Saeed Izadi, led the Palestine Corps of the overseas arm, or Quds Force, Katz said in a statement.

The Israeli military later said that it killed a second commander of the Guards' overseas arm, who it identified as Benham Shariyari, during a strike on his vehicle overnight in western Tehran.

It said the commander “was responsible for all weapons transfers from the Iranian regime to its proxies across the Middle East”.

Shariyari supplied missiles and rockets launched at Israel to Hezbollah, Hamas and Yemen's Houthis, according to the Israeli military.

There was no confirmation from the IRGC on the killing of the two commanders.

The Quds Force built up a network of Arab allies known as the Axis of Resistance, establishing Hezbollah in Lebanon in 1982 and supporting the Palestinian militant Islamist group Hamas in the Gaza Strip.

But the Iran-aligned network has suffered major blows over the last two years, as Israeli offensives since Hamas' October 7, 2023, attacks on Israel have weakened both the Palestinian group and Hezbollah.

Katz said Izadi financed and armed Hamas during the initial attacks, describing the commander's killing as a “major achievement for Israeli intelligence and the Air Force”.

Izadi was sanctioned by the US and Britain over what they said were his ties to Hamas and Palestinian militant faction Islamic Jihad, which also took part in the October 7 attacks. — Reuters",REAL

""Given the strong local sentiment towards Sabah-based parties ahead of this election, I foresee us contesting 52 seats, subject to the approval of GRS chairman Datuk Seri Hajiji Noor,"" said Parti Gagasan Rakyat Sabah (Gagasan Rakyat) vice-president Datuk Masiung Banah.

""The remaining 21 seats will be allocated to national parties that agree to cooperate with GRS,"" Parti Gagasan Rakyat Sabah (Gagasan Rakyat) vice-president Datuk Masiung Banah told hundreds of attendees at a roadshow in Kampung Mananam, Tenom, on Saturday (May 24).

Banah expressed confidence that local candidates under the GRS banner could outperform opposition parties, particularly those previously rejected by voters during their time in government.

The Kuamut assemblyman stressed that GRS would be more cautious in forming future alliances, citing the failed power grab attempt during the “Langkah Kinabalu” episode in January 2023.

Several opposition assemblymen and political leaders from Sabah Barisan Nasional and Parti Warisan, along with defectors who allegedly wanted to align state power, tried to engineer a change of government by persuading elected representatives to switch allegiance and withdraw support from Hajiji.

However, the plan failed after Hajiji managed to retain majority support in the Sabah State Legislative Assembly, thanks to backing from most GRS component parties, several Sabah Barisan assemblymen, and Sabah Pakatan Harapan, which pledged support for political stability.

Banah, meanwhile, stated that the current working relationship between GRS and Sabah Pakatan, both politically and administratively, remains strong and should be maintained.

He believes that if the collaboration continues into the upcoming election, the coalition stands a strong chance of forming the Sabah government once again.

Earlier, Banah received a warm welcome from the Orang Sungai Making ethnic community at the Mananam District Polling Centre (PDM), accompanied by a convoy of over 30 motorcycles waving GRS flags.

The GRS roadshow was attended by all division chiefs from the coalition’s component parties in the Kuamut constituency.

Sabah CM hints at possible state polls announcement after late July party meet,"KUALA LUMPUR, June 15 — Amid ongoing speculation that the 17th state election may happen at the end of July or early August, Chief Minister Datuk Seri Panglima Hajiji Noor said there is no rush to set a date for dissolving the State Legislative Assembly.

However, he hinted that an announcement could be made after the Parti Gagasan Rakyat Sabah (Gagasan Rakyat) General Assembly scheduled for the end of July.

“Not yet, we will have our general assembly meeting at the end of July first,” he told reporters after officiating the Gagasan Rakyat Sulaman division’s annual conference at Dewan Seri Sulaman here on Sunday.

The Gagasan Rakyat President and Sulaman Division chief was responding to questions from reporters about the possibility of the state assembly being dissolved at the end of July to make way for the 17th Sabah State Election.

Meanwhile, Hajiji, who is also Gabungan Rakyat Sabah (GRS) chairman, stressed that the ruling coalition is ready to face any party in the 17th state election.

He said while this was GRS’s stance, but any decision on the form of political cooperation for the upcoming state election must be made by the coalition’s Supreme Council.

“GRS is ready to face anyone in the upcoming election. That is our position, but any form of cooperation must be decided by the GRS Supreme Council,” he said.

He also expressed his support for the views of GRS Deputy Secretary-General Datuk Armizan Mohd Ali, who agreed that GRS should face off against Barisan Nasional (BN) in the upcoming state election.

“I support his opinion, but we have yet to make a final decision. This doesn’t come from me, it’s BN that has said they are not interested. We shouldn’t force anyone if they’re not keen,” he said.

Armizan had said he personally agreed with Umno Sabah chief Datuk Seri Bung Moktar Radin that GRS and BN should go head-to-head in the state election.

Meanwhile, Hajiji said the Gagasan Rakyat Annual General Assembly this time around is important, as it is being held ahead of the upcoming state election.

“My reminder and advice to all Gagasan Rakyat and GRS members is for them to remain united. Close ranks, strengthen the party machinery, and prepare for the election that is just around the corner,” he said.

Earlier, in his speech, Hajiji reminded Gagasan Rakyat and GRS leaders and members to learn from the current political situation and to counter the falsehoods being spread by the opposition on social media.

“We must be wise in distinguishing between slander and lies, and what the government is actually doing.

Never fall for the slander and lies spread by the opposition.

“Let the opposition spread slander, but we in Gagasan Rakyat must stand together with our allies in GRS Plus especially here in Sulaman,” he said.

He also elaborated on GRS’s position for the upcoming 17th state election particularly in regard to its potential allies for the polls.

“Many people have asked me about our situation, who our allies are, and where we will be contesting.

While no final decision has been made yet, as I will need to discuss it with the GRS component parties. We are currently more comfortable with the existing arrangement in government, which is GRS-PH Plus.

“This is the sentiment among the people on the ground right now. Our rakyat want this. Many other parties speak arrogantly and boast outside, but I bring this matter to GRS. I do not make decisions on my own.

that’s my principle. Let the GRS Supreme Council decide the direction we take in the coming election,” he said.

On the Sulaman state seat he has held since 1990, Hajiji expressed confidence that it can continue to be retained under GRS in the upcoming state election.

He also hoped that the three other state seats in the Tuaran parliamentary constituency Pantai Dalit, Tamparuli and Kiulu, would also remain under GRS. — The Borneo Post",REAL

"Anwar hails progress on LCS project, stresses importance of good governance","LUMUT, June 15 — Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim has expressed his satisfaction with the progress of the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) construction by Lumut Naval Shipyard (Lunas) at the Royal Malaysian Navy (RMN) base here, describing it as commendable.

He said the progress demonstrated the government’s strong commitment to prioritising national security assets and reflected the Madani government’s emphasis on good governance.

“We regard the RMN as a key line of defence, as our waters are not immune to threats such as terrorism, potential foreign incursions and smuggling. That is why I agreed for the LCS project to continue under the Finance Ministry.

“Previous delays stemmed from weak management, governance issues and corruption. If the management is poor, how can we ensure maritime security? That’s why good governance is essential,” he said in his speech at the Kenduri Rakyat programme held in conjunction with the Perak Madani Rakyat Programme 2025 at Shariff Hall, RMN Lumut here today.

Also present was Communications Minister Datuk Fahmi Fadzil.

Earlier, the prime minister visited the Lunas facility at the RMN base to inspect the ongoing LCS construction works.

Meanwhile, Anwar said the government remains attentive to the need to enhance the country’s defence assets, with the Defence Ministry being among the ministries receiving the largest allocations in the annual budget.

“Defence ranks third (in terms of allocation), after education and health. For 2025 alone, RM21.2 billion has been allocated - a significant amount for a developing nation,” he said.

He added that the move reflected the government’s appreciation of the sacrifices made by the security forces and was aimed at ensuring national stability, which is crucial for economic growth.

Anwar also said he is often moved when learning of the poor condition of certain security assets that are still in use to safeguard the nation.

“That’s why, upon the formation of the Madani Government, I called in all the armed forces chiefs and asked them to outline their priority needs. Based on that, we work to secure sufficient funding to improve our defence machinery and assets,” he said. — Bernama",REAL

Actress-singer Fazura prefers to leave legal issues to lawyers; prefers to concentrate on new single composed by Indonesian ace Ade Govinda,"KUALA LUMPUR: Nearly two months have passed since allegations emerged that the company owned by popular actress and entrepreneur Nur Fazura Sharifuddin failed to settle a RM4.65 million debt owed to a headscarf manufacturing factory.

Despite being repeatedly pressed by the claimant as well as by netizens on social media to address the issue, the celebrity has remained silent, going about her daily life, including promoting her headscarves on social media.

And on Saturday, she notched up a big step in her career after launching the music video of her latest single ‘Luar Biasa’ which is composed by ace Indonesian producer Ade Govinda.

Speaking to reporters at a press conference after launching the music video Fazura, 41, said the lawsuit against her company is a confidential matter and has been handed over to her lawyers for further action.

Fazura, who is also a singer and television host, said she preferred not to comment further as it involves two separate entities.

""Honestly, there’s nothing I can explain because we have to understand that I, Fazura, and the company are two different entities.

QuickCheck: Does eating durian increase your cholesterol levels?,"LOVE it or hate it (though most Malaysians love it!) durians are a fact of life in our part of the world. Being such an integral part of the local culture, no visit from a foreign relative or friend is complete without dragging your hapless relation to a durian store to see where on the ""acquired taste"" spectrum they fall on.

Once considered a seasonal fruit, nowadays the mighty durian is available all year around though some have wondered if this was actually a good thing.

Some have even said that consuming too much of this odiferous fruit might lead you to folly. They've even gone as far to say that durians, among other things, can cause your cholesterol levels to spike so should be consumed infrequently.

Is it true that durians are high in cholesterol?

Verdict:

FALSE

Thankfully, durians do not cause your cholesterol levels to spike.

Furthermore, some studies suggest that durians actually have significant cholesterol fighting properties.

Which makes sense as the fruit is reasonably high in heart-healthy monounsaturated fats which help lower your bad LDL cholesterol levels.

One study in 2019 by researchers from Universiti Sultan Zainal Abidin also found that Malaysian, Thai, and Indonesian durian varieties showed that durian possessed numerous good effects.

Study concluded that it's anti-hyperglycaemic meaning it lowers your blood sugar level. It's also anti-atherosclerotic (stops the thickening of your arteries) and has probiotic effects.

The study even suggested that durian was anti-proliferative, meaning that it could slow down the growth of malignant cells.

Aside from the 'super-food' sounding attributes, it is also high in various vitamins and minerals.

Aside from the cholesterol myth, another popular one is that eating durian and drinking beer at the same time may kill you.

There is no scientific evidence to show that this is a lethal combination nor has there been any recorded cases so this too, is just a myth.

What might be going on is that the combination might cause bloating and indigestion as your liver has to work extra hard to metabolise both the fats and sugars from the combination.

Another myth is that durian is a 'heaty' fruit. This might sound controversial, but heaty-ness is not an accepted medical condition known to modern to modern medicine so to each their own.

If anything, durians are a little bit too nutritious as they're also high in sugars and other carbohydrates. This seems at odds with its anti-hyperglycaemic qualities but there most likely is some mechanism involved that requires more study. Nevertheless, it is something to consider if sugar is a concern for you.

In conclusion, as with anything good in life, feel free to indulge but please do so in moderation. Also, if you happen to have any medical conditions please talk to your doctor first before making any decision that will impact your diet.

Schoolkids do Malaysia proud,"LANGKAWI: About 30 children in vibrant traditional outfits charmed the audience during the grand finale of the Asean Ministers of Education and Higher Education Roundtables (#EduRoundtables2025) gala dinner.

Aged between seven and 13, the pupils from SK Temonyong made a grand entrance during the final performance by artiste Aisya Retno, marking the close of the three-day event on Thursday.

Waving the Asean flag featuring 10 stalks of padi bound together to represent the unity and solidarity of the member states, the children embodied the spirit of regional harmony.

Dressed in costumes reflecting Malaysia’s rich cultural heritage, they brought warmth, colour and a sense of unity to the prestigious gathering.

Among the performers was Muhammad Haziq Zuhair Mohd Hafriz, nine, who proudly showcased Malaysian identity to the international delegates.

He eagerly accepted the opportunity when invited by his teacher.

Arash Fatihi Muhammad Afifi, 13, said they only had two days to practise before the event.

“We’re proud we pulled it off,” he said.

As the eldest sibling, he was happy to make his school and Langkawi proud.

He hoped more pupils would be given similar opportunities, as such events build confidence and create lasting memories.

Fathiah Damia Fairuz Akmal, 10, described her participation in the event as a proud moment.

“I was nervous at first, but also excited,” she said, adding that her parents were very supportive and encouraged her to join similar events in the future.

Earlier, Higher Education Minister Datuk Seri Dr Zambry Abd Kadir, who hosted the event, said the gala dinner was a tribute to the unity and shared purpose that bound Asean member states together as one family.

“Tonight’s gala dinner stands as a meaningful expression of our collective commitment to the noble cause of Our Asean Shared Future: 2045,” he said in his speech.

“In an era of rapid change and growing complexity, our solidarity is our greatest strength.

“Together, we have shown that when education becomes the bridge between our aspirations and actions, the future becomes not only possible, but also promising.”

Zambry also expressed his deepest appreciation to all education ministers and senior officials for their invaluable contributions throughout the meeting.

He said their presence and active participation had reflected the region’s strong resolve to build a more inclusive, resilient and forward-looking Asean through education.

Also present was Education Minister Fadhlina Sidek, who together with Zambry, launched the Asean Global Exchange for Mobility & Scholarship (Asean GEMS), a platform that serves as a one-stop hub for information on scholarships and mobility programmes available across the Asean region.

Guests at the dinner were treated to an array of Malaysian delicacies, including beef rendang and ayam percik.

"Trade, nuclear energy, tech deals: DPM Fadillah heads to Uzbekistan, Russia to deepen bilateral ties","KUALA LUMPUR, June 19 — Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Fadillah Yusof will embark on an official visit to Uzbekistan and Russia from June 20 to 28 to strengthen bilateral economic relations and explore cooperation in energy and high technology.

This will be his first official visit to both countries as deputy prime minister and includes meetings with senior government leaders, bilateral talks, and site visits to strategic facilities such as energy infrastructure and innovation hubs.

In Uzbekistan, the visit aims to build on ties renewed during President Shavkat Mirziyoyev’s visit to Malaysia earlier this year.

In the capital Tashkent, Fadillah — who is also Minister of Energy Transition and Water Transformation — is expected to pay a courtesy call on President Mirziyoyev and hold a bilateral meeting with Energy Minister Jurabek Mirzamahmudov to enhance energy cooperation.

According to the ministry’s itinerary, Fadillah will also deliver the keynote address at the Malaysia-Uzbekistan Business Forum 2025, aimed at linking businesses from both countries.

Malaysia-Uzbekistan trade reached RM369.8 million (US$80.9 million) in 2024, with Malaysia enjoying a surplus of RM360.3 million (US$78.9 million), according to news reports.

Malaysia’s main exports to Uzbekistan include palm oil, palm-based oleochemicals, processed food, coffee, margarine, shortening and coconut oil, while key imports are fertilisers, fruits and textiles.

Fadillah’s visit to Russia begins on June 24, where he will meet Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak.

A key highlight will be the exchange of a non-disclosure agreement between MyPower Corp and Russia’s state nuclear agency Rosatom, as Malaysia continues assessing nuclear energy as part of its net-zero emissions goal by 2050.

Fadillah is also expected to visit Rosatom’s nuclear facilities in St Petersburg.

The visit comes on the heels of Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim’s state visit to Russia in May, during which President Vladimir Putin pledged joint ventures in natural gas and peaceful nuclear energy, including expanding Petronas’s operations in the country.

Malaysia and Russia established diplomatic ties in 1967.

In 2024, Russia was Malaysia’s ninth-largest trading partner in Europe, with trade totalling RM11.46 billion (US$2.48 billion). Major Malaysian exports to Russia included electrical and electronic products, machinery and parts, and processed food. — Bernama",REAL

“Such cases are complex, and we do not rely solely on video evidence. Other evidence and witness statements are critical to the investigation. Whether the video is authentic or not, it will be evaluated alongside other evidence,” he said, according to Sinar Harian.

The MACC chief added that the agency has submitted the findings to prosecutors for further action.

The corruption scandal, which centres on Sabah’s mineral mining licenses, made headlines last year and is now set to result in criminal charges against the three individuals involved.

"AI, blockchain tech can either fight corruption or fuel it, says MACC chief","KOTA KINABALU, June 18 — Digital innovations such as artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology in work processes, taxation, e-commerce, and ESG (environmental, social and governance) reporting hold significant potential to enhance audit quality and facilitate greater compliance.

Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) chief commissioner Tan Sri Azam Baki said that while advanced technologies bring numerous benefits, they also present new opportunities for corruption, fraud, and abuse of trust if not properly governed.

“From a governance standpoint, even the most robust systems can be manipulated if those managing them lack integrity and accountability,” he said.

He said this when officiating the International Conference on Technology, Management and Sustainability (ICTMS 2025), organised by the Accounting Research Institute (ARI), Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM), here today.

Speaking to reporters later, Azam said the MACC is actively developing a new system aimed at enhancing the efficiency and impact of anti-corruption enforcement efforts.

According to him, the adoption of modern technology has significantly accelerated the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission’s (MACC) investigation and intelligence processes, with most cases now being resolved within three to six months, compared to previous years.

Meanwhile, Azam said the MACC is also in discussions with the Attorney-General’s Chambers to implement a Deferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA), an initiative focused on the recovery of large sums of money to be returned to the country.

“This new approach will involve setting policy for cases that emphasise not just prosecution, but also the recovery of funds, particularly in high-profile cases,” he said. — Bernama",REAL

"After deadly bus crash, Perak MB urges federal support for East-West Highway and Gerik Hospital upgrades in 13MP","IPOH, June 21 — Perak Menteri Besar Datuk Seri Saarani Mohamad has expressed hope that the proposal to upgrade the East-West Highway (JRTB) linking Gerik and Jeli will be included in the 13th Malaysia Plan (13MP).

Saarani said the state government had conveyed its intention to Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim during his visit to Lumut last week.

“What’s most important is to reassess the alignment and widening of the JRTB. The upgrade involves more than just resurfacing; it requires a full reconstruction, as the existing structure is so old that some of the damage has exposed the road base.

“This highway has been in use for over 40 years, and simply patching up damaged sections may no longer be sufficient. However, the state government fully understands that constructing a new alignment or rebuilding the JRTB would require substantial funding,” he said at a press conference after officiating the closing ceremony of the 2025 National Training Week at the Ipoh Convention Centre here today.

Saarani said the state government has also instructed the State Infrastructure, Energy, Water and Public Transport chairman, Datuk Seri Mohammad Nizar Jamaluddin, and Human Resources, Health, Indian Community Affairs and National Integration chairman A. Sivanesan, to prepare a report and study on upgrading the JRTB and Gerik Hospital.

“Mohammad Nizar will obtain information and data from the Works Ministry regarding the upgrade of the JRTB, while Sivanesan is working on applying to the Health Ministry for the upgrading of Gerik Hospital, as there is an urgent need in the event of accidents. Typically, victims are taken to Hospital Taiping or the Raja Permaisuri Bainun Hospital.

“If upgraded, it would be sufficient for patients or victims to be treated at Gerik Hospital, provided it is equipped with the necessary facilities and expertise. Once the study is completed, we will submit a letter to the relevant ministry,” he added.

In the early hours of June 9, a tragic accident along the JRTB near Tasik Banding, Gerik, claimed the lives of 15 Universiti Perguruan Sultan Idris (UPSI) students when the chartered bus transporting them from Jertih, Terengganu, to the main campus in Tanjong Malim, Perak, was involved in a crash.

The crash also left 33 others injured, including the bus driver and his assistant, as well as the driver and three passengers of a multi-purpose vehicle. — Bernama",REAL

Perak seeks comprehensive upgrade of East-West Highway,"IPOH: The Perak state government aims to include a comprehensive upgrade of the East-West Highway in the upcoming 13th Malaysia Plan, says Datuk Seri Saarani Mohamad.

The Perak Mentri Besar said that the proposal is essential and discussions with the Public Works Department are underway, as the state believes patching the 40-year-old highway is no longer sufficient.

“The federal government, through JKR, should reassess the highway’s alignment and consider a full reconstruction, not just resurfacing.

“This is because the highway structure is outdated and parts of the damage even expose the base layer, and simple patch jobs will likely no longer suffice.

“We understand it requires a substantial allocation, and when I was with the Prime Minister at a recent event in Lumut, I took the opportunity to raise this matter and conveyed our concerns about the highway,” he told reporters after closing the National Training Week (NTW) 2025 on Saturday (June 21).

Saarani mentioned that the Prime Minister noted the high cost involved.

“But at the very least, the state government has registered our official stance. We will send an official letter once the state executive councillor obtains accurate data and technical input from JKR, as this is a technical matter,” he said.

Saarani added that the state executive councillor in charge of health is also asked to prepare a formal application to the Health Ministry to upgrade the hospital and medical facilities in Gerik.

He said due to frequent accidents along the highway, Gerik Hospital has become a critical facility and needs adequate specialists and infrastructure.

“This is very important, otherwise, accident victims have to be transported to Taiping or Ipoh.

“If Gerik Hospital is sufficiently upgraded with the necessary facilities and expertise, it would be enough to treat those patients there.

“Sometimes it takes around two hours to travel from Gerik to Ipoh, and the same to Taiping.

“If the injury is severe, immediate treatment in Gerik would be sufficient if it has the proper equipment and specialists,” he said.

Asked if there was any timeframe given to both the state executive councillors, Saarani answered no.

"Penang to continue vape industry talks before deciding on possible ban, says state exco","BUTTERWORTH, June 21 — The Penang government will continue holding engagement sessions with stakeholders on the vape industry before considering implementing a ban on it in the state.

State Youth, Sports and Health Committee chairman Daniel Gooi Zi Sen said the engagement sessions aim to gather views and suggestions from all parties on the matter.

“Last Thursday, I met with representatives from the Vape Entrepreneurs Group Association, and we listened to the various issues they raised concerning the industry, particularly regarding Act 852 – the Control of Smoking Products for Public Health Act 2024.

“They also expressed concerns about the impact of the act’s implementation on the industry, and based on the feedback received, Act 852 can be considered one of the strictest regulatory frameworks in the country compared to other industries,” he told reporters after attending an Engagement Programme with the National Anti-Drug Agency (AADK) and Persatuan Mencegah Dadah Malaysia (Pemadam), here today.

Gooi said the state government is also prepared to consider a ban on vape sales if the enforcement of Act 852, which takes effect on Oct 1, does not yield the desired positive outcomes.

He said that a regulatory mechanism for the supply of electronic cigarettes has been introduced through the act, and the strategy to reduce its usage in Penang must be implemented in a comprehensive and planned manner.

"KLIA Aerotrain to resume service for travellers on July 1, Transport Ministry announces","SEPANG, June 21 — The new Aerotrain service at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) will officially begin operations come July 1.

Confirming service resumption next month, Transport Minister Anthony Loke said he is hopeful the latest development would allow a greater comfort for travelling passengers transiting between the main terminal and the satellite building.

“I am happy to announce that we are entering the final phase of testings in the coming days.

“If all goes smoothly, we have decided to reopen the train service at 10am on July 1,” he told a press conference after attending a trial-run at the KLIA Terminal 1 building here.

At present, Loke said the final phase of testing involved live simulations of the Emergency Response Plan (ERP) and relevant personnels.

He also said the existing feeder bus system will remain operational as a support for the time being to the Aerotrain system until it reaches optimal level.

“If and when everything is operating optimally, the management (Malaysia Airports Holdings Berhad) will determine whether to discontinue or retain the service,” he said.

He added that safety is always top priority, and that all trials were being monitored by the Land Public Transport Agency (Apad), later acknowledging the delays in service resumption.

“Safety is very important. That is why we took time to carry out various tests. These tests are of course monitored by Apad.

Describing the service resumption as timely, Loke said Malaysia is set to host several Asean meetings later this year and welcome more international visitors in conjunction with Visit Malaysia Year 2026.

“KLIA, of course, is our major gateway in Malaysia, and we are looking forward to the resumption of the aerotrain to make the entire process at KLIA even smoother.

“This year is important because we are the chair of Asean, and by 2026, it is a major year for Malaysia’s tourism because we are hosting Visit Malaysia Year so the resumption of the aerotrain is a very important part of that preparation,” he said.

With a transit time of under two minutes, each aerotrain set comes in three coaches with a passenger capacity of 90 each — bringing the total number of each set to 270.

During peak hours, two coaches will be in operation; while only one will be in operation during off-peak hours from 12am to 5am.

The Aerotrain, a key component of KLIA’s internal transport system since 1998, was suspended in March 2023 following a breakdown.

The new Aerotrain system is expected to improve the passenger experience, reduce operational disruptions, and support the anticipated increase in air passenger traffic in the coming years.",REAL

"Austrian shooter posted online just before school massacre, media say","VIENNA (Reuters) -The 21-year-old man behind Austria's worst school shooting posted on social media from the building just before he shot dead 10 people then killed himself this week, Austrian newspapers reported on Friday.

Police described the Austrian as an introvert and an avid player of online shooting games who had largely withdrawn from the outside world before he carefully planned Tuesday's attack.

Newspapers Heute and Kronen Zeitung published details of a photo the young man apparently took inside a toilet cubicle with a timestamp minutes before police said the attack began in the school in Graz, a city in the southern state of Styria.

The photo was published on X, they said.

Kronen Zeitung said the man had an interest in the 1999 U.S. Columbine school massacre in Colorado carried out by two teenage shooters and that he apparently used a photo of one of the pair on his profile with his online gaming pseudonym.

Heute said the man had also published pictures of the pistol and the shotgun he would go on to use during the shooting on other social media.

A spokesman for police in Styria declined to confirm the reports or whether the man had social media accounts.

Police have been scouring the perpetrator's electronic devices, and said on Thursday that they had not discovered any video of the high school shooting on his mobile phone.

"India says Indus treaty with Pakistan ‘will never be restored’, vows to divert river flow","NEW DELHI, June 21 — India will never restore the Indus Waters Treaty with Islamabad, and the water flowing to Pakistan will be diverted for internal use, Home Minister Amit Shah said in an interview with Times of India today.

India put into “abeyance” its participation in the 1960 treaty, which governs the usage of the Indus river system, after 26 civilians in Indian Kashmir were killed in what Delhi described as an act of terror.

The treaty had guaranteed water access for 80 per cent of Pakistan’s farms through three rivers originating in India.

Pakistan has denied involvement in the incident, but the accord remains dormant despite a ceasefire agreed upon by the two nuclear-armed neighbours last month following their worst fighting in decades.

“No, it will never be restored,” Shah told the daily.

“We will take water that was flowing to Pakistan to Rajasthan by constructing a canal. Pakistan will be starved of water that it has been getting unjustifiably,” Shah said, referring to the northwestern Indian state.

The latest comments from Shah, the most powerful cabinet minister in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s cabinet, have dimmed Islamabad’s hopes for negotiations on the treaty in the near term.

Last month, Reuters reported that India plans to dramatically increase the water it draws from a major river that feeds Pakistani farms downstream, as part of retaliatory action.

Pakistan’s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to Reuters’ request for comments.

But it has said in the past that the treaty has no provision for one side to unilaterally pull back and that any blocking of river water flowing to Pakistan will be considered “an act of war”.

Islamabad is also exploring a legal challenge to India’s decision to hold the treaty in abeyance under international law. — Reuters",REAL

"Pakistan to nominate Trump for Nobel Peace Prize, calls him a ‘genuine peacemaker’ with ‘stellar statesmanship’","ISLAMABAD, June 21 — Pakistan said today it would recommend US President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, an accolade that he has said he craves, for his work in helping to resolve the recent conflict between India and Pakistan.

Some analysts in Pakistan said the move might persuade Trump to think again about potentially joining Israel in striking Iran’s nuclear facilities. Pakistan has condemned Israel’s action as a violation of international law and a threat to regional stability.

In May, a surprise announcement by Trump of a ceasefire brought an abrupt end to a four-day conflict between nuclear-armed foes India and Pakistan. Trump has since repeatedly said that he averted a nuclear war, saved millions of lives, and grumbled that he got no credit for it.

Pakistan agrees that US diplomatic intervention ended the fighting, but India says it was a bilateral agreement between the two militaries.

“President Trump demonstrated great strategic foresight and stellar statesmanship through robust diplomatic engagement with both Islamabad and New Delhi, which de-escalated a rapidly deteriorating situation,” Pakistan said. “This intervention stands as a testament to his role as a genuine peacemaker.”

Governments can nominate people for the Nobel Peace Prize. There was no immediate response from Washington. A spokesperson for the Indian government did not respond to a request for comment.

Trump has repeatedly said that he’s willing to mediate between India and Pakistan over the disputed Kashmir region, their main source of enmity. Islamabad, which has long called for international attention to Kashmir, is delighted.

But his stance has upended US policy in South Asia, which had favored India as a counterweight to China, and put in question previously close relations between Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

In a social media post yesterday, Trump gave a long list of conflicts he said he had resolved, including India and Pakistan and the Abraham accords in his first term between Israel and some Muslim-majority countries. He added: “I won’t get a Nobel Peace Prize no matter what I do.”

Pakistan’s move to nominate Trump came in the same week its army chief, Field Marshal Asim Munir, met the US leader for lunch. It was the first time that a Pakistani military leader had been invited to the White House when a civilian government was in place in Islamabad.

Trump’s planned meeting with Modi at the G7 summit in Canada last week did not take place after the US president left early, but the two later spoke by phone, in which Modi said “India does not and will never accept mediation” in its dispute with Pakistan, according to the Indian government.

Mushahid Hussain, a former chair of the Senate Defence Committee in Pakistan’s parliament, suggested nominating Trump for the peace prize was justified.

“Trump is good for Pakistan,” he said. “If this panders to Trump’s ego, so be it. All the European leaders have been sucking up to him big time.”

But the move was not universally applauded in Pakistan, where Trump’s support for Israel’s war in Gaza has inflamed passions.

“Israel’s sugar daddy in Gaza and cheerleader of its attacks on Iran isn’t a candidate for any prize,” said Talat Hussain, a prominent Pakistani television political talk show host, in a post on X. “And what if he starts to kiss Modi on both cheeks again after a few months?” — Reuters",REAL

"Chief justice explains in case judgment that SIS challenge concerns legality of Selangor’s fatwa powers, not Islam itself","PUTRAJAYA, June 21 — The appeal by Sisters in Islam (SIS) Forum (Malaysia) does not concern the substantive beliefs in the religion of Islam, its mandates or doctrines relating to the Islamic faith but relates to the exercise of legal powers by certain state authorities, says the Federal Court in its judgment.

Chief Justice Tun Tengku Maimun Tuan Mat said the challenge only concerned the review of the Selangor State Fatwa Committee, the Selangor Islamic Religious Council (MAIS) and the Selangor government’s exercise of certain powers under the law, which is distinct from the substance and contents of their decisions.

“While it concerns a certain fatwa (religious edict), the case has neither to do with the substantive beliefs held in the religion of Islam nor does it have anything to do with the administration of the substantive aspects of the religion of Islam,” she said in the 40-page majority judgment.

The top judge said in all civilised democracies with independent judiciaries, it is routine for the executive’s decisions to be subjected to judicial review and in most cases, the subject matter of the exercise of discretion in the plaint is not the main issue rather the manner in which the decision was made.

On Thursday, the Federal Court bench, in a 3-1 majority ruling, held that the 2014 fatwa issued by the Selangor State Fatwa Committee and gazetted by the Selangor state government is valid, but only insofar as it applies to individuals, not companies.

The court ruled that a fatwa cannot be imposed on an organisation like SIS Forum as it is not capable of professing a religion.

The ruling partially allowed the appeal by SIS Forum and its co-founder Zainah Mahfoozah Anwar to quash the 2014 fatwa, which had declared the group as deviating from Islamic teachings.

In the written judgment released on the judiciary’s website, Justice Tengku Maimun explained that the Selangor state government and the religious bodies are part of the executive branch and are empowered by the Federal Constitution and laws passed by the Selangor State Legislative Assembly (SLA).

“The fact that they deal with matters pertaining to Islamic faith, dogma and doctrine — are beside the point and these matters are, in any event, not within our purview (of the Civil Court),” she said.

Justice Tengku Maimun said that under Article 121 (1A) of the Federal Constitution, the Shariah Courts have exclusive jurisdiction over matters within their scope. However, if the Shariah Courts act beyond their jurisdiction, they remain subject to judicial review by the Superior Courts.

She reiterated that SIS Forum’s legal challenge did not question the contents of the fatwa but the way it affected them.

This, she said, involved constitutional importance and administrative law, which is for the Superior Courts to determine.

The Chief Justice also reminded all judges that judgments of the Federal Court, unless overruled by a later decision of the same court, are binding and failure to abide by them is an affront to the administration of the justice system.

In the judgment, Tengku Maimun also said a fatwa, once gazetted, carries the force of law and is not mere suggestion, and it is binding on all Muslims in the state and the Shariah Courts. — Bernama",REAL

Manalo was responding to questions on Israel’s actions in Palestine, following Manila’s chairmanship of the ASEAN-Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Ministerial Meeting at the Kuala Lumpur Convention Centre (KLCC) earlier on Sunday.

The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) has warned that the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza will worsen unless aid delivery remains uninterrupted.

Qatar News Agency (QNA) reported that the Israeli blockade, which began on March 2, has pushed Gaza’s 2.4 million residents to the brink of famine.

Over the past 80 days, 58 individuals have died from malnutrition, while another 242-primarily children and the elderly-have succumbed to a lack of food and medicine, the report added.

Commenting on Sunday’s ministerial meeting, Manalo noted that the implementation of the Asean-GCC Framework of Cooperation 2024-2028 is progressing well.

The framework is a comprehensive plan to strengthen cooperation between Asean and the GCC across political, economic, and socio-cultural sectors.

""Well, I think it’s making good progress, and today we had a very good meeting to reaffirm that. I think tomorrow’s summit will further cement our growing cooperation between Asean and the GCC,” he said.

The 46th Asean Summit and its related meetings, scheduled for May 26 and 27 under Malaysia’s 2025 Chairmanship theme ‘Inclusivity and Sustainability’, are expected to address a broad range of pressing regional and international issues, particularly political and security concerns.

This year marks Malaysia’s fifth time chairing the regional bloc, having previously held the ASEAN Chairmanship in 1977, 1997, 2005, and 2015. - Bernama",REAL
Malaysia suffer first ever defeat to Wales and finish sixth in Nations Cup,"BUKIT JALIL: The national hockey team walked out with heads hung low after finishing sixth at the Nations Cup on Saturday (June 21).

The Speedy Tigers’ weaknesses once again were laid bare as they lost 1-2 to Wales in the fifth-sixth classification match at the National Hockey Stadium and failed to meet the top five target set by coach Sarjit Singh.

Desperate to redeem themselves at the tournament after failing to make it to the semi-finals, Syed Mohd Syafiq Syed Cholan gave the hosts the lead in the 20th minute after converting a penalty corner.

Malaysia then let their opponents catch up when Rhys Bradshaw equalised in the 42nd minute through a penalty corner as well.

Wales’ Gareth Furlong then delivered the final blow to Malaysia in the final quarter, scoring the second goal from a penalty corner in the 50th minute.

It was an extra sweet win for Wales as it was their first win in the past six meetings with Malaysia. Malaysia last won against them in 2021 during a test match at the Reading Hockey Club in England.",REAL
"Klang fatal shooting: ""I thought it was a crow-shooting operation"", says shop owner","KLANG: The daily routine of the community in Taman Meru Utama came to a standstill when the peace was shattered by the sound of gunfire in front of a motorcycle shop that claimed the life of a local man on Friday (June 20).

At the time of the incident, a retail shop owner, a woman who wished to remain anonymous, revealed that the shooting happened so quickly that it was difficult for the public to ascertain where several gunshots - heard at about 3.20pm - were coming from.

""I was tying flowers to make a garland when I heard an explosion like firecrackers, then I looked towards a motorcycle shop which was just 20m away and saw several individuals, including the motorcycle shop workers, running towards my store.

""I thought it was a crow-shooting operation but that hasn’t been staged here for a long time since many trees have been cut down (where crows perch), … then I realised someone has been shot and killed in a vehicle right in front of the motorcycle shop,” she told Bernama here on Saturday (June 21).

The woman in her 50s also said that this was the first incident of its kind to occur near Taman Meru Utama in the five years she and her family have been running a grocery and food business.

On Friday, North Klang police chief ACP S Vijaya Rao confirmed that a 46-year-old local man had died from gunshot wounds in a four-wheel drive pickup truck, with a post-mortem scheduled for 9am today.

When contacted today, Vijaya Rao said police were investigating possible secret society elements in the case.

He said several individuals had so far been called in to have their statements recorded.

""Preliminary investigations found that the victim, who was self-employed, was accompanying his friend who wanted to buy a second-hand motorcycle at the shop.

""He was believed to have been shot at close range, and a post-mortem is still ongoing,” he said, adding that the police were also reviewing closed-circuit television (CCTV) footage from the surrounding area.

The case is being investigated under Section 302 of the Penal Code for murder.- Bernama",REAL

"In Johor, three men claim trial to bribing senior Immigration officer after nightclub raid","JOHOR BARU, June 17 — Three men were jointly charged in the Sessions Court here today for allegedly attempting to bribe a senior enforcement officer during a raid at an entertainment centre in Kluang five months ago.

The accused — Gan Chi Qian, 25; Lai Yee Keong, 42; and Wong Kent Sing, 51 — pleaded not guilty after the charge was read out by a court interpreter before Judge Datuk Ahmad Kamal Arifin Ismail.

According to the charge, the trio jointly offered a bribe of RM25,000 in cash to the Johor Immigration Department’s enforcement division deputy assistant director during an Ops Gegar raid at the nightclub.

The bribe was allegedly an inducement to prevent enforcement action against five foreign workers who had violated Regulation 39(b) of the Immigration Regulations 1963, which prohibits breaching the conditions of their passes. The offence carries a penalty of up to six months’ imprisonment, a fine of up to RM1,000, or both.

The accused, employed at a factory in Kluang, are alleged to have committed the offence at around 4.30am on January 11 at the Johor Immigration Department’s enforcement division office in the Home Ministry Complex, Taman Setia Tropika.

The charge was brought under Section 214 of the Penal Code, read together with Section 34 for acts committed with common intention. If convicted, they face imprisonment of up to one-quarter of the maximum penalty for the original offence, a fine, or both.

Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) prosecuting officer Fazal Lisam Abidin represented the prosecution, while counsel Abraham Mathew represented the accused.

The prosecution proposed bail of RM15,000 for each accused, but Mathew requested a reduced sum, citing their RM2,000 monthly incomes as factory workers.

The court granted bail of RM5,000 with one surety for each accused and set July 18 for mention and document submission.",REAL

"Anwar: Malaysia-US tariff talks ‘going excellent’, urges fair deal for Asean too","KUALA LUMPUR, June 19 — Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim today said that Putrajaya’s ongoing negotiations with Washington over unilateral tariffs imposed by former US President Donald Trump are “going excellent”.

He said two ministers — Investment, Trade and Industry Minister Datuk Seri Tengku Zafrul Abdul Aziz and Finance Minister II Datuk Seri Amir Hamzah Azizan — held talks with US Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick yesterday to advance the tariff negotiations.

“I said to them to secure what is fair for Malaysia but also present the case that is best for Asean too,” he said, during his keynote address at the 38th Asia-Pacific Roundtable (APR) at Hilton KL, here, today.

Malaysia currently faces a 24 per cent tariff on all goods entering the US, and is seeking to lower the rate to the 10 per cent baseline tariff.

Anwar acknowledged the economic strain caused by the tariffs but stressed that Malaysia’s bilateral relations with the US remain strong.

“Some of our differences in foreign policies cannot be too exaggerated because our bilateral relations with the US remains strong,” he said.

Anwar added that Asean is working to upgrade trade agreements with member states and dialogue partners, as the US tariffs continue to cast a shadow over the region.

He also said he was confident that the conclusion of the Digital Economic Framework Agreement (Defa) will help unlock the potential of the region’s digital economy.

The agreement is to be the world’s first region-wide and legally binding agreement on digital economy governance.

“In the face of rising protectionism, we must remind ourselves that trade is not a sideshow to security — it is part of the scaffolding that holds the region together,” he said.

“When trade falters, fractures follow.”

Anwar also defended Asean leaders’ engagement with the BRICS bloc, saying it should not be seen as an anti-Western move but rather a means to tackle shared challenges.

BRICS comprises Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.

“The recent reinvigoration of BRICS to include members and partner countries from the Middle East, Southeast Asia, Central Asia, Africa, and South America, is the very essence of bridging regions,” he said.

“It is an opportunity to build new partnerships and renew old ones,” he added.

Malaysia formally applied to join BRICS in July 2024 and was admitted as a partner country in October.

Cambodia orders troops on 'alert' in Thai border spat,"Phnom Penh, June 13, 2025 (AFP) - Cambodia ordered troops to stay on ""full alert"" and banned Thai dramas on television on Friday in an ongoing border spat between the South-East Asian neighbours.

Phnom Penh also shut off internet connections routed through Thailand on the eve of a meeting between the two sides aimed at defusing tensions following deadly clashes last month.

Violence flared on May 28 in an area known as the Emerald Triangle, where the borders of Cambodia, Thailand and Laos meet, with one Cambodian soldier killed.

Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet posted on Facebook late Thursday that the country was disconnecting all internet bandwidth from Thailand, leaving some users complaining of slow speeds.

The ministries of information and cultures also ordered television stations and cinemas to stop airing Thai TV series.

Influential former leader Hun Sen -- Hun Manet's father -- urged the government on Friday to halt ""imports of Thai goods into the Cambodian market"" if Thailand refused to lift restrictions imposed on border checkpoints in recent days.

He told troops to be on alert, writing on Facebook: ""All armed forces must remain on full alert 24 hours a day, ready to respond and defend in the event of aggression.""

Hun Sen also urged authorities in provinces near the border be prepared to evacuate residents to safer areas.

Cambodian authorities also announced that the popular Daung-Ban Laem border crossing with Thailand would be closed indefinitely from Friday.

The Cambodian immigration department said the measure was to keep ""security and safety for people"".

In another Facebook post, Hun Sen encouraged Thai farmers to protest against their military.

He said Cambodia would reopen the border crossing when all border restrictions imposed by the Thai military were lifted.

Cambodian and Thai officials will meet in Phnom Penh on Saturday to discuss the border dispute.

The row dates back to the drawing of the 800-kilometre (500-mile) frontier, largely done during the French occupation of Indochina.

The region has seen sporadic violence since 2008, resulting in at least 28 deaths.

Hun Manet announced earlier this month that Cambodia would file a complaint with the International Court of Justice (ICJ) over four disputed border areas, including the site of the latest clash.

The ICJ ruled in 2013 that a disputed area next to Preah Vihear temple belonged to Cambodia, but Thailand says it does not accept the ICJ's jurisdiction.

On Sunday, armies from both countries agreed to reposition their soldiers in the site of the latest clash to avoid confrontations.

"Thai PM ‘will continue to perform her duty’, is not resigning or dissolving parliament, ruling party official says","BANGKOK, June 21 — Thailand’s embattled prime minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra will not resign or dissolve parliament, a senior official from the ruling Pheu Thai party said today, risking a prolonged political crisis in Southeast Asia’s second largest economy.

Sorawong Thienthong, who also serves as Thailand’s tourism minister, said in a Facebook post that the prime minister would not quit, despite growing calls for her resignation after her apparent mishandling of a border dispute with neighbouring Cambodia.

“The prime minister has clearly confirmed to us that she will continue to perform her duty to resolve various crises that the country is facing to the best of her ability,” he said.

“The government confirms that it will continue to work, not resign, and not dissolve parliament.”

Paetongtarn, daughter of divisive tycoon and former premier Thaksin Shinawatra, is facing domestic anger over the leak of a phone call between her and Cambodia’s influential former leader Hun Sen, in which she appeared to kowtow before the veteran politician and denigrated a senior Thai military commander.

The Bhumjaithai Party, which was the second-biggest partner in Thailand’s ruling coalition, withdrew from the alliance late on Wednesday, citing the leak earlier that day.

Another coalition member, the United Thai Nation party, looked set to demand Paetongtarn’s resignation in return for backing the Pheu Thai-led ruling coalition and securing its narrow parliamentary majority.

Paetongtarn has apologised for the call with Hun Sen, but not commented on the crisis so far.

Activists have also scheduled a protest in Bangkok starting on June 28 to ask for Paetongtarn’s resignation, among them groups with a history of influential rallies against Shinawatra administrations. — Reuters",REAL

"China offers to be peacemaker in Iran-Israel war, but is unlikely to intervene","BEIJING (The Straits Times/ANN): As the conflict between Israel and Iran stretches beyond a week, China has found itself sidelined in developments that could yet have far-reaching consequences for its interests in the Middle East.

While Beijing has offered itself as a peacemaker, it is unlikely to wade into the conflict directly, or to supply arms to Iran, say analysts. This is because it wants to avoid confronting the United States, for which military intervention against Iran remains a real possibility.

Chinese President Xi Jinping, in a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on June 19, said China is willing to continue to strengthen communication with all parties and “play a constructive role in restoring peace in the Middle East”.

Hours later, US President Donald Trump effectively gave Iran two weeks to return to the negotiating table to discuss the future of its nuclear programme, by saying he would decide whether the US would attack Iran in that timeframe.

With Iran seriously weakened by the latest hostilities – its top military commanders have been killed, and key nuclear facilities damaged – observers believe the initiative remains with Israel and the US.

At stake for China is energy imports. China is the largest buyer of Iranian oil.

Iran has also threatened to block the Strait of Hormuz, which lies between Iran and Oman and is a major route for oil and gas shipments from the Gulf states to China, including from Saudi Arabia, China’s biggest supplier of crude after Russia.

Even so, beyond issuing diplomatic statements, China is unlikely to intervene, said analysts.

While some have touted China’s growing influence in the Middle East, particularly after it brokered a landmark normalisation deal between archrivals Saudi Arabia and Iran in 2023, it has little appetite to be embroiled in the region’s conflicts.

Associate Professor Jonathan Fulton, an expert in China’s relations with the Middle East, said China’s interests in the Middle East are primarily economic, noting also that it buys much more oil from countries such as Saudi Arabia and Oman than Iran.

“When China looks at Iran, I think they see a partner of limited economic value,” he said. “They also see a country that, through its proxies or its own aggressive behaviour, has destabilised a lot of the Middle East.”

Another major reason for China’s inaction is that it does not want to antagonise the US, said Prof Fulton, who is non-resident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, a US think-tank.

“Much like the logic with Ukraine – if China gives weapons to Russia and Russia uses them to attack Ukraine, this is going to provoke Nato and make China an enemy in the eyes of countries that it wants to have good economic and political relations with,” he added.

Chinese officials have repeatedly called for a ceasefire since Israel began a major offensive against Iran on June 12 to cripple Tehran’s ability to develop nuclear weapons, seen by Israel as a threat to its security.

Since that first salvo, there have been tit-for-tat air strikes between the two countries, an ongoing conflict that could yet lead to the overthrow of the leaders of the Islamic republic.

China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi has suggested through phone calls to his counterparts in the Middle East – Iran and Israel, as well as Egypt and Oman which are involved in mediation efforts – that China is willing to coordinate with regional countries for peace.

Dr Clemens Chay, a research fellow from the Middle East Institute at the National University of Singapore, said: “Beyond the perfunctory statements and calls by Chinese officials, it is unlikely Beijing will stick its hand in – certainly not militarily – in the ongoing tit-for-tat strikes between Iran and Israel.”

Given that China has energy interests in the region, including in Iranian oil, the logical approach for it would be to call for de-escalation, he said. “But to deploy its forces will be too much of an ask.”

Dr Andrea Ghiselli, a lecturer in international politics at the University of Exeter who focuses on Chinese foreign policy in the Middle East, said Mr Wang’s phone calls should be read as a way for China to get a better read of the situation.

China is probably seeking to understand how regional powers and countries like Russia are preparing for a possible collapse of the regime in Iran and the consequent emergence of Israel as a regional hegemon, said Dr Ghiselli, who also heads research at the ChinaMed Project of the Torino World Affairs Institute, an Italian think-tank.

A possible regime change in Iran – which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said could happen, even if his government does not aim to bring it about – would also not likely be welcomed by China, not least because the next leadership may be less predictable.

Dr Gedaliah Afterman of Reichman University in Israel said a quick collapse of the regime or power vacuum would threaten China’s investments, infrastructure and strategic access across the region.

“Beijing prefers continuity and predictability, particularly given Iran’s current economic dependence on China,” he added.

He said the best-case scenario for China is a swift de-escalation that avoids direct US-Iran confrontation, preserves the existing regional order in which Beijing feels increasingly comfortable, and enables it to continue balancing relations with Iran, the Gulf and Israel.

“China may also seek to present itself as playing a role in any renewed nuclear agreement, even if only symbolically, especially if this comes at the expense of US influence in the region,” said Dr Afterman. - The Straits Times/Asia News Network",REAL

"From a Russian prison, US schoolteacher tells lawyers he was grabbed by Moscow's soldiers","LONDON (Reuters) -A 73-year-old American jailed by Russia as a mercenary for Ukraine protested his innocence when his U.S.-based legal team and family finally tracked him down in April, months after he vanished into the vast Russian prison system, they said.

Stephen Hubbard, a retired schoolteacher, was sentenced last October to almost seven years in a penal colony after a court found him guilty of serving in a Ukrainian territorial defence unit against Russian forces, tasked with manning a checkpoint.

Russian state media reported that he had entered a guilty plea in the closed-door trial.

The U.S. Embassy in Moscow has not been granted consular access to Hubbard, a State Department spokesperson said, adding that U.S. officials have requested his immediate release.

Martin De Luca, his U.S.-based lawyer, told Reuters it was not until this April that his legal team learned Hubbard was being held in a facility in the Mordovia region, east of Moscow.

""The first thing Hubbard wanted to talk about when he was able to make contact with the outside world was: 'It's not true,'"" said De Luca, who made his first public comments on the case to the New York Times this week.

""They (Russian soldiers) grabbed him from his house. He was not in any combat or military unit"", De Luca recalled Hubbard saying.

Joseph Coleman, a son from Hubbard's first marriage who lives in Cyprus, said he spoke to his father in prison by phone for less than five minutes on May 28.

""He did sound a little down,"" Coleman told Reuters. ""He said, 'I'm tired of being a slave.'""

At least eight other Americans are currently imprisoned in Russia, which has stepped up arrests of alleged mercenaries for Ukraine since its 2022 invasion of its neighbour.

But Hubbard is the only one designated by the U.S. as ""wrongfully detained,"" making him a top candidate to be returned in any future prisoner exchange. The Kremlin said last month the two sides were discussing a possible swap involving nine people on each side.

A document written on the letterhead of the IK-12 penal colony, signed by a prison official and seen by Reuters, says that Hubbard is incarcerated there.

Russia's federal prison service did not respond to an emailed request for confirmation from Reuters. Other U.S. citizens previously jailed in Russia have been incarcerated in the same region.

VIDEO CLUES

Hubbard, a Michigan native who taught English abroad for decades, had moved to Izium in eastern Ukraine in 2014 to be with a Ukrainian girlfriend, but by 2022 he was living there alone, his family said. Russian forces captured Izium in April 2022.

After his arrest, his family struggled to establish what had happened to him.

They caught glimpses of him in videos posted online in pro-war Russian Telegram channels. One showed what appeared to be a staged interrogation.

In another, Hubbard appeared with his hands zip-tied and whimpered as a man slapped him with a plastic sandal. His sister, Patricia Hubbard Fox, identified her brother in both videos in conversations with Reuters. The agency could not verify when and where the videos were taken.

""He is so non-military,"" Hubbard Fox told Reuters last year, expressing doubt that her brother would have taken up arms for any state.

""He never had a gun, owned a gun, done any of that... He's more of a pacifist.""

TRACKING HIM DOWN

After Hubbard's trial, De Luca and his team at a U.S. law firm began working to secure his release.

They picked up the case in late February. It wasn't easy to find him, De Luca said.

""Russia is still a functioning country. There are laws, bureaucracies, processes that get followed,"" he said.

The team located Hubbard at the penal colony in Molochnitsa, a very small town about a seven-hour drive from Moscow.

De Luca said the team has been able to call Hubbard three times since April. He described him as weak after months living in a prisoner-of-war camp.

Mohamad Fazli said the incident forced the LRA, which processes 318 million litres daily, to be shutdown and affecting not only residents but also schools, hospitals, industrial zones and data centres.

“I have not slept in four days and will like to apologised to fellow lawmakers for skipping scheduled questions in this August House due to the incident.

“People needed answers, and I had to lead coordination efforts with Ranhill SAJ and other agencies,” he added.

Mohamad Fazli also said that he was not acting as a spokesman for the water operator but rather as a public servant determined to provide clarity.

“People want to know what happened, why the delay, and when their taps will work again?” he said adding that the core failure was the lack of safeguards on the pumps.

He added that once water entered the facility due to a leak at one of the nine pumps, the entire station was submerged where no early alert was triggered.

“How could it get to that point before any alarm went off? It took 12 hours just to drain the water before we could even begin diagnostics,” he said.

Mohamad Fazli said that each pump had to be removed, dried in an industrial oven in Senai, and reinstalled one by one.

He added that due to the delayed restoration timelines, the state was forced to roll out emergency supply efforts including 41 water tankers and 13,000 cartons of bottled water.

Mohamad Fazli said by Thursday (May 22), two pumps were running at 50% capacity, followed by three at 75% later that afternoon with full capacity was only restored at 7pm.

He added that repair did not mean recovery as it took additional time for treated water to reach dry storage tanks and distribution networks.

Mohamad Fazli said areas like Tebrau, Kempas and Johor Baru city only regained full water supply in the early hours of Friday.

He urged Johor’s utility companies to improve risk management, adopt new technologies, and embrace a culture of excellence in their services to avoid disruption.

“We must manage disasters with dedication, data, cooperation, and modern tools because the goal is not just to fix what’s broken but to build something better for the future of Johor,” he said.",REAL

"Tiger returns to Kampung Ulu Dingin, leaving villagers fearful after latest livestock attack","KULIM, June 17 — Villagers in Kampung Ulu Dingin in this district are living in fear again over the presence of a tiger which has reportedly returned to attack their livestock recently.

Livestock farmer Muhammad Khairul Azlan Che Hamid, 37, claimed that the latest attack occurred last Thursday (June 12) with a pregnant cow being killed by the endangered predator.

“This is the first attack of the year. In past years, several attacks have occurred, by the same tiger I believe.

“In 2023, two of my cows were killed while in 2024, four cows fell victim to tiger attacks. Altogether, including this year, seven cows have died,” he claimed, speaking to Bernama in the village today.

He said he has been raising cattle since 2010 and curently owns 70 cows kept in a fenced area.

“But when my fence is damaged, like it is under repair currently, some cows will inevitably stray and roam in the nearby oil palm plantation,” said Muhammad Khairul Azlan.

He added that his home, where he lives with his wife and two children and a livestock pen, is located not far from the foothills of Gunung Inas, while the distance between their home and neighbours is quite far, thus adding to their concerns about safety with the tiger back on the prowl.

Meanwhile, Mukim Mahang village chief Mohd Naim Zamhuri Zainul Abidin said that so far this year, three complaints have been received from villagers regarding alleged tiger attacks.

“We have forwarded all the cases to the Department of Wildlife and National Parks (Perhilitan) for further action,” he said.

According to him, Perhilitan has set two traps baited with goats in Kampung Ulu Dingin and Kampung Ulu Mahang.

“The village where these tiger attacks occurred is home to about 10 families with houses located quite far apart from each other,” he said. — Bernama",REAL

Perak Mentri Besar urges calm over mysterious tremors,"IPOH: Amid rising public concern over recurring loud booms and brief tremors reported in several areas, the Perak Mentri Besar has urged calm and assured residents that no seismic activity has been officially detected in the state.

Datuk Seri Saarani Mohamad acknowledged that strange vibrations had recently been felt in Ipoh and surrounding areas, similar to an unexplained incident in 2024.

“Last year, people in Taiping, Kuala Kangsar, and even Ipoh experienced what they described as an explosion-like tremor. Each believed it happened in their own area.

“The phenomenon, which has yet to be scientifically explained, was also reportedly felt in Selangor earlier this year, adding to speculation about its origins,” he told reporters after closing the National Training Week (NTW) 2025 at the Ipoh Convention Centre on Friday (June 21).

The incident on June 18, around 10.30am, sparked concern among residents in Chemor, Chepor, and Tanah Hitam.

Saarani called for the matter to be studied by relevant technical departments or geological experts, as current monitoring systems have not confirmed any earthquakes or ground tremors in Malaysia.

“We do not know yet what exactly is happening, but I hope the public doesn’t panic. So far, there has been no detection of any earthquake or tremor.

“Authorities are expected to consult the Malaysian Meteorological Department (MetMalaysia) and geological researchers to further investigate the cause of these mysterious tremors,” he said.",REAL

"China, US officials agree to ‘framework’ that will need approvals by Xi, Trump","China and the United States wrapped up two days of high-level trade talks in London with an agreement “in principle to a framework” that each side will bring home for review by their top leaders.

“The two sides agreed in principle a framework for implementing the consensus” that Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump reached in their phone call last week, and the consensus of high-level bilateral negotiations in Geneva last month, China’s top trade negotiator Li Chenggang told reporters.

“The two sides will bring back a report to our respective leaders the talks in the meeting as well as the framework that was reached in Geneva. We hope that the progress that we made in this London meeting will be conducive to the increasing trust between China and the United States.”

Using similar language – “agreed in principle a framework” – US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said his delegation was “going to go back and speak to President Trump and make sure he approves it”.

“They’re going to go back and speak to President Xi and make sure he approves it, and if that is approved, we will then implement the framework that we have worked hard over these last two days,” he said. “Both sides had extra impetus in order to get things done because we both have our presidents behind us, pushing us to make sure we take care of our respective sides.”

“The idea behind all of this is for us to increase our trade with China, right? ... The fundamental goal is to reduce the trade deficit and increase trade,” Lutnick added. “So this was the first step of the framework by which we will then approach and discuss growing trade.”

The talks are the latest bid to defuse tensions between the world’s two largest economies over an array of trade and technology issues, which remain at boiling point despite their agreeing to a temporary deal last month to scale back tariffs on each other’s goods.

The meeting in London came just days after a phone call between Xi and Trump, during which the leaders agreed to push forward with negotiations aimed at resolving their ongoing economic disputes.

China’s delegation was led by Vice-Premier He Lifeng. Lutnick, US Treasury Scott Bessent and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer led the US side in what was described as “the first meeting of the China-US economic and trade consultation mechanism”.

Tensions escalated dramatically in the days leading up to last week’s presidential phone call, with both sides accusing each other of violating the 90-day trade truce they had agreed to in Geneva in mid-May.

While Lutnick and Greer projected confidence that the framework would be approved and that they were on track to avoid a return to the full tariff levels that were in place before the Geneva meeting, Greer suggested that some differences would remain.

“We are very focused on implementing the Geneva agreement and the president’s consensus,” Greer said. “When that happens, that’s really going to unlock the ability to talk about more things. And again, there are some things that the Chinese and US economies, they just don’t fit together very well. Other things, maybe they do.”

The temporary trade truce between the US and China will end on August 12, unless the agreement reached in Geneva is extended. US tariffs on Chinese imports have fallen from as high as 145 per cent to 30 per cent, while Beijing’s duties on American imports have dropped from 125 per cent to 10 per cent.

Washington had placed new export curbs on sales of jet engine and chip design technologies to China, while growing increasingly alarmed by Beijing’s failure to speed up approvals for exports of rare earths.

Rare earths have become a central issue in the tussle between the rival powers, as China’s control over global supplies of a slew of critical minerals has given it significant leverage in dealings with the US.

Reducing America’s reliance on Chinese minerals was a major focus of a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing on Tuesday, during which witnesses urged Washington to build up mineral supply chains with Southeast Asia through trade agreements.

“These agreements should include criteria for trusted critical mineral supply chains and guaranteed supplies of critical mineral resources for US industry,” said Barbara Weisel of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace think tank, citing a US-Japan minerals agreement as a successful model.

Several countries in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations have “important critical minerals” and are interested in partnering with Washington, Weisel added.

Even so, the former assistant US trade representative for Southeast Asia and the Pacific cautioned that the US must send consistent signals, noting that a recent Commerce Department investigation into the national security implications of critical mineral imports had left countries in the region uneasy about the risk of new tariffs.

Meanwhile, China’s Ministry of Commerce on Saturday said it had approved several applications for exports of rare earths-related materials and was ready to deepen dialogue with other nations over its export control system.

Chinese authorities have reportedly granted temporary export licenses to rare earth suppliers serving the US’ top three carmakers, with some of the licenses valid for six months.

At a separate hearing in Washington on Tuesday, US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth called sourcing critical minerals “a number one” priority for his team to ensure they are procured “in America first, and if not, then amongst allies”.

“China undercuts the market intentionally to try to corner the market, and we have to account for that,” Hegseth told a congressional hearing of the House Appropriations defence subcommittee.

The Pentagon chief’s remarks came in response to US congresswoman Susie Lee, a Nevada Democrat, who cited a New York Times report published on Monday saying the Defence Department had paid an Australian firm 10 times more than it paid Nevada-based MP Materials to secure critical minerals supplies.

According to the report, the Pentagon awarded MP Materials – operator of the only active US rare earth mine in Nevada – a US$35 million contract in 2022 to produce several rare earth elements, including samarium, which is subject to Chinese export restrictions.

Soon after, the Joe Biden administration provided US$351 million to Australia’s Lynas Rare Earths to build a processing facility in Texas.

“MP, the largest US rare earth producer, has invested US$1 billion of its own capital since 2020 and employs more than 800 Americans,” said Lee. “Yet it was undercut by an Australian firm that never even broke ground in the US.” - SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST",REAL

"China approves world’s biggest amphibious plane, AG600, for mass production","China’s home-grown AG600, the world’s largest amphibious aircraft, has been given the green light for mass production, marking a step forward in building an independent and globally competitive aviation industry.

The Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) certified the plane on Wednesday, confirming that its developer, the state-owned Aviation Industry Corporation of China (Avic), has established a reliable system to consistently produce aircraft that meet safety standards, according to state broadcaster CCTV.

Avic said the approval was a milestone towards a “more high-end and standardised” civil aviation manufacturing sector, and that it “strengthened China’s ability to independently build a complete civil aviation ecosystem”, CCTV reported.

The development is part of China’s broader push to build a self-reliant civil aviation industry and position itself as a major player in the global sector. The goal has gained urgency in light of the United States’ recent technology curbs, including restrictions on jet engine exports.

The AG600 is one of three large aircraft developed domestically, alongside the Y-20 strategic transport plane and the C919 narrowbody airliner – both in active service.

China developed the AG600 to meet urgent needs in emergency rescue and natural disaster prevention and control, state media previously reported.

With a maximum take-off weight of 60 tonnes and a practical range of 4,500 kilometres, the aircraft can carry up to 12 tonnes of water for firefighting missions.

The AG600’s development involved hundreds of supporting enterprises and tens of thousands of components, underscoring China’s ability to coordinate the design and manufacturing of large specialised aircraft, as well as managing their complex supply chains, according to state news agency Xinhua.

The project also provided “replicable management experience and technical standards for future domestically developed aircraft”, the report added.

The AG600 entered batch production and final assembly in July last year, with the CAAC issuing a type certificate – confirming its design meets airworthiness standards – in April.

Avic now plans to expand the AG600 product line and strengthen the country’s aviation-based emergency response capabilities, according to Xinhua. - SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST",REAL
